        "text": "MEET THE MAKERS\n\nMEET THE MAKERS: LA SOVRANA\nAt Lina Stores we are very lucky to partner with a number of producers and suppliers both in Italy and the UK who bring the best quality products to our restaurants and delicatessens. La Sovrana, a UK- and Italy-based produce business, is the perfect example of a business bridging the gap between both countries. Entirely family-run, La Sovrana started on a farm in Battipaglia, Campania, and travelled all the way to New Covent Garden Market in London to work tirelessly to source the best seasonal fruit, vegetables and cheeses for us.\nWe had the pleasure of visiting our friends at La Sovrana at New Covent Garden Market where they not only invited us with open arms but also sent us away with enough mozzarella and tomatoes to last the week! We spoke to Alfonso Picaro, the Director of La Sovrana, who told us all about their story, their produce and his favourite Lina Stores dish!\n\nTell us a little bit about La Sovrana. What inspired you to start La Sovrana? When was it set up and where are you located?\nLa Sovrana was born in 2011 in Battipaglia in South Italy only twenty minutes from the Amalfi coast. We are a family-run business and the third generation of growers, who started with just one farm in Campania.\nI have always been passionate about trading, and we had some difficulties with our farm in Italy, so when I heard about the wonderful opportunities that the English market could offer us, I decided to move La Sovrana to London. I began as a packer for another Italian company and slowly began to introduce our products to them. I started working in the market in May and sent my first load all the way to London in August. At this time, we produced mainly rocket, parsley, fennel and beautiful Amalfi lemons.\nI then began trading solely in markets as an agent for our farm, selling products to wholesalers around London. However, when COVID hit and all the restaurants closed, I purchased a small van and went from shop to shop trying to sell our products. I went from selling half a palette to driving around with a full lorry of Italian produce all in the space of a couple of months. Some shops were even ringing us two to three times a day because they were running out of our stuff!\nWe now supply around one hundred and twenty restaurants and shops with our delicious fruit, vegetables and cheeses.\n\nYou are a small family-run business - tell us a little bit more about your values and how the family dynamic contributes to your success.\nMy brother and I are the third generation of traders in our family. Along with my team, I am in charge of managing the company on this side, while my brother oversees our farm in Battipaglia while also collaborating with farms in other parts of Italy to source the best seasonal produce for us. Our main values are quality and trust. We take great care in ensuring that we only source the highest quality products as this is what is most important to us as well as giving the best service and consultation to our customers. We truly believe in quality over everything else.\n\nIf you could choose a favourite product of yours, what would it\nbe and why?\nOur pride and joy is the Amalfi Lemons! After six years there are people who call them Sovrana lemons and not Amalfi anymore so we are very glad to spread the best quality and that people identify us with a very high standard. As well as having our own small orchard, my brother visits the Amalfi coast where we buy and harvest the lemons ourselves. These are easily one of our best sellers and are used in many of the dishes at Lina Stores, such as the Spaghetti alla Chitarra with Amalfi Lemons, Pink Peppercorns and Grana Padano.\n\nYou supply us with a lot of different produce here at Lina Stores, what are these and, to your knowledge, what dishes do we use them for?\nThe main produce that we supply Lina Stores with are fruit and vegetables as well as some fresh cheeses. Some of the products that you use at Lina Stoers include the Amalfi lemons in Spaghetti alla Chitarra dish with Amalfi Lemons, Pink Peppercorns and Grana Padano. You also use our beautiful Datterini tomatoes for the Burrata Ravioli with Datterini Tomatoes, Pinenuts and Basil. Our Buffalo Burrata is also currently available on your antipasti menu too!\nWhen they are on the menu, we also provide Lina Stores with aubergines for your Aubergine Polpette. We work very closely with the Lina Stores team to ensure that we are providing products that are in season and at the best stage of production.\nWhat is your favourite thing about working with Lina Stores/do you have any memorable moments working with us??\nI remember getting a phone call from Lina Stores and was overcome with emotion when I was told that you wanted to work with us here at La Sovrana! Lina Stores is such an instituion and a real home away from home for an Italian like me so it was the perfect match! From the beginning we have always had a great relationship and I speak to your chefs often. It really is a pleasure to work alongside a team of people who are always a step ahead and push us to be the best we can possibly be.",

        "text": "MEET THE MAKERS\n\nMEET THE MAKERS: ROCCA DELLE MAC\u00ccE\nAt the heart of Italian culture lies a deep love for winemaking. The passion and cultivation of truly beautiful flavours, grape varieties and styles around regional Italy is renowned globally.\nWhile food has been at the heart of Lina Stores since we first opened in 1944, the right glass of wine has the power to elevate a dish and transform it into something extraordinary. We therefore showcase a large variety of as many organic and biodynamic wines from independent producers from all corners of Italy, including the great winemaker regions of Piedmont, Tuscany, Campania and Veneto.\nWe are delighted to welcome our newest producer to the \u201cMeet the Makers\u201d series: Rocca delle Mac\u00ece, a stunning winery on a hilltop in Castellina in Chianti founded by film producer Italo Zingarelli and is now managed by his son Sergio. We have the pleasure of working with the family in producing our very own Lina Stores wines and were lucky to sit down with them to learn about their story, craft and passion for winemaking.\n\nCan you share a brief history of your winery and how you got started in the wine production business?\nRocca delle Mac\u00ece was founded in 1973 by my father Italo Zingarelli, who, following a series of successful ventures in the film industry, chose to fulfill his childhood dream of buying a large farm and turning it into a model farm.\nAfter his visit to the village of Le Mac\u00ece, he felt that he had finally discovered what he had been searching for. He aptly named his finding Rocca delle Mac\u00ece. In the Tuscan dialect, \"mac\u00eca\" refers to a collection of stones, and Rocca delle Mac\u00ece represents a sturdy and majestic hilltop fortress. In the early months of 1973, my father embarked on the restoration of the farm's 14th-century buildings, while simultaneously initiating the process of planting new vineyards and olive groves.\nAt the end of the same year, we began restoring our newly acquired land - the estate of Sant\u2019Alfonso. Italo's love for the country alongside a fresh way of viewing agricultural investment led to the construction of a cellar provided with the most modern equipment used in the village of Rocca delle Mac\u00ece.\nOur wines made their first appearance on the Italian and foreign markets in 1978 and were immediately welcomed with enthusiasm, especially by restaurants and wine shops. These first successes encouraged Italo to continue investing and in 1984 he bought a new farm called Fizzano which was already well-known for the quality of its wines.\nIn the early 80s, I began working alongside my father. From the very beginning, he instilled in me the importance of establishing a direct, open, and honest relationship with our customers. This essential foundation is crucial for any collaborative endeavour we undertake. Beyond this, our hard work and unwavering efforts to ensure that our wines continue to improve in quality, coupled with meticulous service in both the cellars and vineyards, constitute the efforts that take place behind the scenes. Today, Rocca delle Mac\u00ece wines are not only featured in the finest restaurants across Italy but also in over 45 countries including the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Germany, Japan and Brazil.\n\nCould you guide us through the wine-making process, starting from the selection of grapes to the final product?\nThe quality of our grapes is guaranteed by the expertise of our workers and by very attentive and selective management in the vineyards. Routine procedures such as green harvest in July and leaf plucking in August promote optimal cluster growth.\nOn top of that, selective pruning after the harvest guarantees low and very balanced yields per hectare. Our fertilisation is completely organic and the fight against vine disease is done in respect of the environment.\nFollowing a careful selection of healthy bunches our grapes are picked by hand and immediately transported to the winery in covered trucks to avoid dust or smashing of the berries in case of a sudden rain.\nIn our cellar, the grapes are soft-pressed - the must first and the wine later are constantly controlled by our winemakers and cellar men with the best modern equipment, starting with a temperature-controlled system for maceration, oak barrels for maturation, and ending with an automatic bottling line.\nMore than 7.000 hectolitres of wine are aged in Slavonian and French oak, in prestigious barriques and in the typical \"caratelli\" for Vin Santo.\n\nWhat types of wines do you produce and what are their distinct characteristics?\nWe offer a diverse selection of six Chianti Classico wines sourced from the Maremma and Chianti regions. Our Chianti Classico and Chianti Classico Riserva are our iconic offerings, crafted from the finest grapes from our four estates. We also produce Morellino di Scansano, Sasyr, Vermentino, Chardonnay and a delightful Ros\u00e9. The combination of dry, hilly soils and the region's warm climate ensures optimal grape ripening, while the brackish sea air contributes to the development of distinct aromatic characteristics.\nFor Lina Stores, we proudly produce two exquisite wines that reflect our winery's heritage and the Italian way of life.\nThe red wine is a 100% Sangiovese IGT sourced from vineyards in the Municipality of Castellina in Chianti, known for optimal vine cultivation conditions. With diverse soils, it offers a range of aromatic profiles and unique sensory characteristics.\nThe white wine is a smooth Vermentino IGT from the sun-kissed southern coast of Tuscany, boasting a beautiful straw-yellow colour. The perfectly ripened grapes are carefully hand-picked, promptly vinified, and bottled after the spring harvest to capture ultimate freshness.\nCan you recommend a food pairing for each of our Lina Stores wines?\nLina Stores Vermentino is a fresh, smooth and balanced white which pairs well with all courses, as an aperitif or with fish and in particular vegetables. This wine is wonderfully aromatic on the nose and pleasantly fruity with notes of acacia and groom.\nLina Stores Sangiovese is a sapid, smooth and full-bodied red. Beautifully intense on the nose, it is pleasantly savoury with red fruit notes. This is a very versatile wine, which can be enjoyed as an aperitif or paired with fish and vegetables, with pasta, red or white meat or with spicy food.\nWhat makes your vineyard unique from others in the region?\nWhat truly distinguishes Rocca delle Mac\u00ece is our inherent sense of family. Every aspect of Rocca carries a deep and interconnected family history; no one is here by chance. The stories of friends, relatives, parents, and children passing the baton all serve as a testament to the invaluable connections that bind us together. While the company has evolved since my dad first acquired the initial hectares, the spirit remains unchanged, residing in our memories, our innovation, and the stories we preserve and pass down through the years.\n\nDo you have a particular memory or story related to your wine-making journey that you'd like to share?\nIt was an unforgettable experience... even now, a smile lights up my face when I recall it. During a business trip with my father in New York, we found ourselves in a restaurant. As we dined, a waiter approached the table next to us, gracefully pouring Chianti Classico. It was an emotional moment for both of us, but he looked particularly moved. He admitted that the moment meant more to him than seeing his own films on the big screen. In that very instant, my path became clear.\n",

        "text": "MEET THE MAKERS\n\nMEET THE MAKERS: TERRE DI SAN VITO\nAt Lina Stores, we aim to provide the highest quality artisanal products by using only the best ingredients in our dishes and products. This is only possible thanks to the tireless dedication, commitment and passion of the excellent producers and suppliers we are lucky enough to collaborate with \u2013 indeed, some have been working with us since we first opened our doors eight decades ago! \n\nTo celebrate our valued partnerships and the incredible people behind the products we use, we are excited to announce our blog series Meet the Makers. In this series, we will introduce some of the exceptional people we work with, who are so very integral to bringing the best possible produce to our delicatessens and restaurants.\n\nJoin us on this exciting journey as we delve into the stories of our exceptional partners and the remarkable products they create. Starting with Terre di San Vito, a family-run business based in Puglia, who make the finest quality extra virgin olive oil for us. We spoke to Monique Elena, the Commercial Director for Terre di San Vito, to learn more about the family and their produce.\nTell us the story of how Terre Di San Vito came to be.\nWe started with a small plot of land that belonged to our grandparents. They used to grow fruit and vegetables for our large family\u2014eleven children\u2014a lot of mouths to feed! Approximately 20 years ago, our uncle Franco gave up his job and decided to restore the land that had been left by our great-grandparents. He had the soil analysed and found the rust-coloured soil was the perfect environment for growing exceptionally flavoursome grapes and produce. We now have organic status for our land, olives, and grapes.\nOver the past 20 years, we have increased the size of our farm to 110 acres, and this has enabled Terre Di San Vito to extend the vineyards and build a cellar, a shop, and a winter wine-tasting room. By adding the neighbouring land to ours, we have been able to increase the number of olive trees and vines while still maintaining traditional values and sustainable methods for working the land. It is indeed a place where work and nature live in perfect harmony.\n\nFamily seems to be the heart and soul of Terre Di San Vito; how does this contribute to the success of the business?\nWe work hard and have the same vision for the land and the products we produce. We discuss ideas and take on board the ideas raised.\nThe land is run by our uncle Franco, our auntie Lucia, our cousins, and a team that we have known for more than 40 years! They are all counted as our family and are fundamental to our success. Family is so important to us \u2013 we rely on, support, and encourage each other as farming is not easy but when a family is doing it together, it is done with love \u2013 with all our heart and soul. This is where our success can be seen. Cousins, aunts, and uncles all come together to lend a hand at key points of the year from helping with all the harvesting to working in the shop, making some of the produce, and helping with the wine-tasting tours! Knowing we are all working toward the same goals because of our love of each other and the land, has made the business what it is today, it has made our family strong and proud.\n\nTalk us through the process of how your olive oil is produced.\nAt Terre Di San Vito, we grow and use Coratina, Ogliarola, and Favolosa olives, and meticulous attention is given to the production process, in particular, harvesting by hand. We believe this is important to ensure optimal quality and flavour. Some of our olive trees are more than 100 years old! Great care and attention are given to all the stages of growing and cultivating our olives for our delicious extra virgin olive oil, and our organic soil is what makes everything here flourish.\nLarge nets are placed under the trees, and the olives are picked by hand. The branches are also shaken, and we use a type of large rake with blunt tines that we run through the branches to release the olives for collection. This makes sure only the olives that are ready are collected. We do this collection during the day as it is important we don\u2019t harm any birds or animals living in or nesting in the trees.\nThe olives are then transported to a local mill, where they are washed and the extraction process takes place. Our olives are cold-pressed on the day they are collected, and this gives us our incredible extra virgin olive oil.\nThe Terre Di San Vito extra virgin olive oil is then stored until we are ready to bottle it in our tinted green bottles, tins, or beautiful handmade terracotta jars. It is in this rich olive oil that we also use to marinate our delicious sundried tomatoes and vegetables.\n\nYou have a beautiful selection of jars to store the Terracotta Olive Oil, where did you get the inspiration for these? And how are they made?\nThis is a task that we have to give full acknowledgement to our Zio Franco, but we all have had our chance to contribute. He is very creative, and his love of history brought the idea to life. The style of the jars is the same as the style of vessels that the people of Puglia have been storing their olive oil and wine in for centuries, each with a unique and distinctive design. They are all designed by our Zio Franco. Once the model has been agreed upon with the potters, they make them by hand, and then each one is hand-painted. We then take them to the processing plant, who have cold-pressed our fabulous olives, and they fill the terracotta jars and seal them with a cork.\nThe jars are then brought back to the Terre Di San Vito estate, where each jar is sealed with our soft wax and labeled\u2014all by hand.\nHow did you start working with Lina Stores? Do you have any other specific favourite dishes or products at Lina Stores?\nIn 2019, at the start of the first Covid lockdown, my brother Johnny decided to import some wine, olive oil, and food from our farm in Puglia as there was no chance we would be able to go there for a while. So we began to look for Italian delis and restaurants that would work well with our family business.\nLina Stores was, in fact, my first choice. Our dad, Michele who is no longer with us, is the older brother of Zio Franco. He came over to the UK some 60 years ago, married my mum, and had 4 children! Being from Bari, food and wine were always so important to him\u2014especially authentic, good-quality food and wine. He used to take us to Lina Stores on Brewer Street in Soho on a Saturday. As we walked in, it was the incredibly rich reminiscent aroma of Italy. We used to look at the enticing meats and our dad would know what we wanted! I\u2019d have a mortadella and mozzarella roll, Johnny a salami and provolone panini and Angie would have whatever she was given! The long counter full of every meat, cheese, and goodies, the shelves of pasta, biscuits, and jams we loved in Italy were there for us, and that memory has stayed with us all our lives. We all still go into the shop and buy our favourite pasta, salami and of course some sweets!\nAs I write this, I swear I can smell your deli produce \u2013 I\u2019ll be in for some mortadella and gorgonzola soon!\n\nWhat are your hopes for Terre Di San Vito in the future?\nI hope our estate in Italy continues to flourish and I\u2019d love to see our wine and olive oil in the most authentic Italian delis, bars, and restaurants across Europe and the UK. I know my family in the UK and in Italy have the same hopes and goals: to continue the legacy and values our great-grandparents handed down to us by doing our best for future generations, the environment and the local community.",

        "text": "Our Seafood\n\nMan cannot live on steak alone, so we decided to apply everything we\u2019ve learnt about beef (pretty much: buy the best meat possible and don\u2019t mess it up) to the fruits of the sea.\n\nBefore we opened the first Hawksmoor we searched the world for the best beef we could find, before realising that it was right here on our doorstep grazing England\u2019s green and pleasant land. As a nation, we\u2019re also lucky enough to be surrounded by some of the best seafood in the world, so it felt like an obvious next step.\n\nAs with beef though, it can be really difficult to get hold of the good stuff. Before it reaches most London\u2019s restaurants, a fish will go on an impressive journey (almost on a par with a salmon\u2019s up-stream migration). But with more lorries, depots, warehouses and markets delays along the way are almost inevitable.\n\nWe wanted to do things differently, so we teamed up with Mitch Tonks, to our mind the best seafood chef in the country and owner of The Seahorse, a great restaurant in Dartmouth that was recently awarded Britain\u2019s Best Restaurant by Observer Food Monthly (something we might have objected to had we not come a close second). He\u2019s helped us negotiate the complex world of seafood sustainability and fishing methods, and has shown us that (like beef) cooking fish this fresh is all about simplicity. He\u2019s also hooked us up with all his fishermen contacts and his pal Nigel who has become our dedicated buyer at Brixham market. Every morning at the dawn auction he selects the best seafood, before sending it directly to us. No middlemen. No warehouses. As with our beef, the seafood we buy isn\u2019t cheap \u2013 the best ingredients rarely are \u2013 but we think it\u2019s definitely worth it.\n\nIf you enjoy your seafood at Hawksmoor then we owe a big debt of gratitude to Mitch, Nigel and the fishermen of Brixham. And a little bit to beef, which taught us a lot about how we should think about food.",

We have worked with Zac for many years, featuring both his local and international truffles on our menus. The secret behind his success? A commitment to quality, sustainability and the noses of his hunting dogs, Stanley and Freddie.\n\nWHY WE USE THEM: No-one does it better.\nTwo hands cupping a large truffle \n\n\n\nLAKE DISTRICT FARMERS\n\n\nLake District Farmers is a farming organisation in the scenic Lake District region. The late Ray Armstrong founded the business in 2009 to help create a quality-driven and sustainable supply chain for family-run fell farms in The Lake District. They specifically work with farmers that respect, nourish and care for their animals in every part of the journey, resulting in a better end product. The company is now run by co-founder Dan Austin who spent much of his childhood on his grandfather\u2019s farm on the south-west corner of the Lakeland fells. Growing up with livestock allowed him to develop a deep understanding of how Cumbrian fell farms operate, with their animals wandering freely in the fields and on the hills. These days, Dan and his team work with over 50 Cumbrian farms and supply some of the UK\u2019s best restaurants with beef, lamb and much more.\n\nWHY WE USE THEM: They produce some of the best quality, breed-specific meat available, prioritise sustainable farming practices and support the local economy.\n\nFLYING FISH SEAFOODS\n\n\nFlying Fish has been supplying the best seafood in the British Isles to the UK\u2019s best chefs since 2006. Based in Cornwall, they specialise in sourcing and distributing a wide variety of fresh, high-quality fish such as halibut, john dory, cod, skate and mackerel which are featured in some of our dishes. They follow a \u2018ship to plate\u2019 mentality, with buyers up before sunrise everyday to select the best fish from the local Day Boats. This then makes their way straight to our kitchen to be used that day. Importantly, the Flying Fish team is dedicated to prioritising the preservation of marine ecosystems around the UK and supporting responsible fishing methods in order to reduce our impact.\n\nWHY WE WORK WITH THEM: They supply fresh, responsibly sourced fish, straight from the waters of Cornwall. What\u2019s not to love?\nScallop shells on a bed of ice\nRaw scallop dish from Marcus Belgravia \nShucked scallops on a grey metal tray\n\nKELTIC SEAFARE\n\n\nKeltic Seafare, established in 1992, is one of the leading shellfish suppliers in the UK.

Their team carefully selects and hand-packs each order as it comes in, ensuring live produce journeys from seabed to table within 24 \u2013 36 hours, promising to provide us with the best product.\n\nTHE WILD ROOM\n\n\nThe Wild Room specialises in wild mushrooms, fresh truffles and foraged produce. The team responsibly forages mushrooms from forests around the world, following the seasons to ensure that they don\u2019t affect the natural environment.

Demand grew and he started trading in the old Covent Garden Market. Fast forward to 2017, and what was once known as John Connell rebranded to become Le March\u00e9 Limited, an exclusive club serving only the top 100 finest dining establishments in London. They are the only distributor at New Covent Garden Market to operate their own warehouse in Rungis International Market, the wholesale market outside Paris. Using their network of expert buyers, Le March\u00e9 supplies the highest quality seasonal fruit, vegetables and other specialist ingredients from the UK, Europe and from across the world.\n\nWHY WE WORK WITH THEM: They prioritise sourcing from local farms and growers, ensuring the freshest seasonal vegetables.

What with pandemical concerns, for the hospitality industry, forced to close by the government for the first time since the Black Death. And even more so for their suppliers. We had furlough and Tiger King and restaurants at least had access to tax breaks and grants. But what about the myriad small businesses that supplied the hospitality industry? They bore the econoimc brunt of Covid. So one chef has decided to say \u2018thank you\u2019.\n\nMichelin Star holder Phil Howard and business partner Rebecca Mascarenhas together reign over Elystan Street, Kitchen W8 and Church Road. And as if that wasn\u2019t enough, somehow Phil also finds the time to run pasta delivery company OTTO. And they\u2019ve decided that now\u2019s the time to honour some of their very best suppliers. So what are you doing for dinner on Wednesday?\n\n \nThe duo are planning a blow-out dinner on Wednesday 18th May at Elystan Street that puts their suppliers front and foremost.\n\nNow\u2019s the time to honour some of their very best suppliers\u2026\n\nThe menu for the evening comprises a \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d. It showcases everything that\u2019s perfect at this time of year! So sea trout, Jersey Royals, wild garlic, morels, asparagus, early strawberries and so on. \n\nAnd Phil\u2019s regular \u201cSix of the Best\u201d tasting menu (available at lunch and dinner for the table) will be featuring some of these glorious new season ingredients.\n\n Elystan street suppliers dinner: Interior\nMouth watering? We\u2019re only getting started\u2026\n\nUp for some homage-ing are Flourish Bakery, who have worked with Phil and Rebecca since 2000 to provide premium handcrafted baked goods and will provide the opening sourdough bread with salted butter.\n\nNext up it\u2019s Clive Thornicroft, head of one of the leading greengrocers in the fine dining sector and elystan street suppliers, Thornicrofts of London. Thornicrofts have provided the veg in the salad of spring vegetables with quails\u2019 eggs, cracked hazelnuts and light truffle cream.\n\nMouth watering? We\u2019re only getting started!\n\nThe crabs that Phil uses at Elyston Street come straight from Devon\u2019s Top Catch, run by Kevin Bartlett. Kevin\u2019s crab can be found in the next course, spaghetti of large Devon cock crab. It comes with spring onions, lemon and butter.\n\n Elystan street suppliers dinner: Phil\nSticking with the sea creatures, Johnny Godden\u2019s Flying Fish is responsible for the fillet of sea trout, served with crushed Jersey Royals, sea beet and weed, trout roe and herbs. The Cornish business is expert in the world of sustainable line-caught day boat fishing. All their stock is, of course, MSC-certified line-caught and sustainably farmed fish and shellfish.\n\nBack onshore, the breast of chicken with a stuffed wing, garlic leaf pesto and new season\u2019s morels is sure to be delicious. Not least because it\u2019s supplied by the Heanen family of butcher HG Walter and The Wild Room\u2019s Mike de Stroumillo.\n\nIf you\u2019ve room, then pudding rolls in with milk many ways with new season\u2019s strawberries courtesy of the Estate Diary in Somerset\u2019s Chew Valley.\n\nAnd, to end, cheese by Ruaridh Buchanan of Buchanans Cheesemonger. According to Phil Howard they have \u2018a sixth sense when it comes to choosing cheeses for chefs, knowing instinctively what will guarantee that customers won\u2019t skip the cheese course\u2019. So you\u2019d better not skip the cheese course!",

He\u2019s been cooking since he was 12 years old and after 14 years of working for other people in their kitchens, cafes, and fine dining restaurants, he took the leap and independently opened Bobo & Wild in 2021. \n\nOver the years Bobo has built relationships with small independent suppliers and producers. This includes bakers, coffee roasters, butchers, farmers, fish smokers, and more that share our passion for quality. Bobo\u2019s worked with them for so many years and now we\u2019re proud to give them a place on our own menu. Some of the friends we hold close are Daniel, Adam & Scarlet from HG Walter who supplies our meats. Lambton & Jackson, our Malden based smokehouse giving us the best smoked salmon which has a three gold star Great Taste Award. Lockdown Bake House started just like the name suggests, in lockdown and they bake our sourdough locally and deliver it fresh every morning.

        "text": "Tommi\u2019s Burger Joint\nOctober 16, 2012  by K  Comments 4\nCategory: American, London Restaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not the best burger in London, not gourmet or blockbuster, but it is good. Especially with their house bearnaise.\n\nThis London pop-up (so I\u2019ve heard on Monocle Radio) comes by way of long time Icelandic burger-joint owner Tommi T\u00f3masson who has ported it from his (current) Hamborgara b\u00fallan chain in his native country. And who has eaten a burger every day for the last 8 years.\n\nThings are kept very simple here, a standard burger with standard fixings (and American cheese). The patty is made from chuck and this can be upgraded to the steak version, a hache mix of rump, ribeye and fillet.\n\nThe cheeseburger costs \u00a35.80 on its own, \u00a39.40 with fries and a drink, while the steak burger is \u00a38.75 with cheese and a small pot of bearnaise. Beef is supplied by HG Walter right by Barons Court tube who specialise in oft-forgotten Scotch Angus beef, which may not be the tenderest of them all, but certainly has good flavour.\n\nThe cheeseburger.\n\n\n\nThe cheeseburger, dissected.\n\n\n\nThe steak burger.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been on two separate occasions now and had both versions of the patty and think that both are really quite delicious. The first time it was jammed packed over lunch hour and I think I waited about 10-15 minutes for my order. On the 2nd visit, the place was real quite, maybe one or two tables, and the wait for two burgers was down to maybe 7-10 minutes.\n\nCooked to medium rare, the standard mince has that dizzying grilled beefy flavour which you and I identify good burgers with. It is adequately seasoned and has a certain greasy juiciness too. The steak version was much of the same but just that bit better. It was chunkier \u2013 almost like diced steak, or even cooked steak tartare \u2013 and beefier. The patties are clearly the highlight here and of notable quality. It just tastes great.\n\nThe glazed bun was sweet, had a nice doughiness about it and is similar to the one used in Byron\u2019s recent special burgers (like say the Uncle Sam). I\u2019ve read that this is made by Millers which already make buns for all the reputed burger places in town including Ad Cod, Byron and Hawksmoor.\n\nI used the bearnaise like a dipping sauce for the burger \u2026and I thought it worked incredibly well to compliment the steak-like flavour and diced beef texture of the patty. Incredibly satisfying.\n\nThe space is really quite brilliant. It does have that faux-Americana feel interpreted through European heritage, but then again, that could just be projected from the background story. It\u2019s small but not overly narrow, each table is spacious enough and during quite times (with the easy listening tracks in background) it is a comfortable place to enjoy your burger (as opposed to abattoir-like screamfest of Meatliqour). On my 2nd visit, I noticed they offer free filter coffee and (free) house sauce that tasted very much like Thousand Island dressing.\n\n\u2026I\u2019ve read that they are also BYO, so if you wanted to channel Miles Raymond and have a spare bottle of \u201961 Cheval Blanc lying around, this could be the place to pop it\u2026\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Tommi\u2019s burger doesn\u2019t have that mammoth effort feel (like say Ad Cod or Honest for example) nor does it try to reinvent the wheel. If there ever was a London burger competition, Tommi\u2019s probably won\u2019t finish near the top. It\u2019s just so modest in comparison. However, it feels exactly like what burgers are meant to be: fast food, diner style, Joe Bloggs idea of perfect nourishment. It\u2019s like the anonymous global franchise before it went global. And this is exactly why I like it.\n\n",

        "text": "Supplier Glossary\nGood food is at the heart of everything we do at Dishpatch, and quality ingredients are key to the success of our restaurant\u2019s dishes, so our food writer Anna Lawson is shining a light on some of the suppliers behind our menus.\n\nArarat Bakery This small but mighty bakery on Dalston\u2019s Ridley Road is a great example of a supplier doing just one thing and doing it extremely well. The family-run business specialises in fluffy, naan-like flatbreads, baked fresh daily in the large rotating oven in its tiny workshop. The team bake around 5,000 breads every day, which are sold to locals at bargain prices (either plain or topped with cheese, egg or keema), as well as to a number of shops and restaurants, including SMOKESTAK and Bubala.\n\nBelazu Set up my school friends Adam and George in 1991, Belazu started life selling fresh olives to delis and restaurants across the UK. The company now sources an array of high quality Mediterranean and Middle Eastern ingredients, from Italian olive oils and vinegars, to Turkish herbs and spices, Greek olives and more.

The company also supplies many restaurants including Bubala and Cafe Murano.\n\nHarvest London Founded by Chris Davies and Matt Chlebek in 2017, Harvest London was born out of a desire to \u2018build a sustainable food system with greater choice\u2019. The company uses hydroponic vertical farming to grow over 100 different edible plants, including the Thai basil used to garnish Farang\u2019s curries.\n\nHG Walter One of London\u2019s most respected butchers, HG Walter is a family-run business, established in 1972. As well as serving London locals from its shop in Baron\u2019s Court, the butchers supplies meat to a huge number of restaurants in London, including Andrew Edmunds, Cafe Murano and Farang.\n\nNatoora\n\nNatoora is a specialist grocers on a mission to transform the food system by sourcing truly seasonal produce from growers who favour sustainable ways of farming.

Founders Jorge Thomas and Charlie Cowling\u2019s aim is \u201cnot to achieve the highest yielding carcasses, but to produce products that are exceptional to cook and eat.\u201d They do this by working with a small network of trusted, family-run farms which only rear exceptional, native rare-breed meat. As well as an online shop for customers nationwide, Swaledale supplies many restaurants across the country, including Farang, the Good Egg and som saa.\n\nWild Farmed \u201cWe make the pastry for our pies and sausage rolls with flour from a great supplier called Wild Farmed Grains,\u201d says Marksman head chef Tom Harris.

Sourcing milk and other dairy products direct from independent UK farmers.\nSwaledale Foods - Butchers\nWe have partnerships with selected farms and work with carefully selected local abattoirs so we have confidence in the welfare of the animals and full traceability of all our products. We support the Rare Breed Survival Trust and offer a comprehensive selection of Native Breed Beef, Lamb & Mutton, Pork and Rose Veal. We also offer Poultry, and wild game when in season.",

        "text": "Eating. It\u2019s one area of our lives where small tweaks to our behaviour can make a massive difference to climate change. Food, and the agriculture system behind it, is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. Restaurants in the UK produce just under 200,000 tonnes of food waste every year, which costs the food industry \u00a3682 million annually. What\u2019s more, raising livestock accounts for 14.5 percent of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nBut now a wave of properly radical London restaurants is helping the industry make major steps towards being greener while still producing incredible food. Over the years, veganism has only gone from strength to strength in the city. There\u2019s a focus on farm-to-fork supply chains and recipes made from food waste. And this stuff is by no means a hippy fad. It\u2019s here to stay. Here are six things we can learn from these industry leaders.\n\nDiscover Time Out original video\nThe Seven Noses of London\nPhotograph: miscusi\nPhotograph: miscusi\n1. Turns out that soil is really important\n\nCult Milanese pasta restaurant miscusi got that status for a reason \u2013 and it\u2019s not just because of its food. Its founders run a regenerative agriculture project just outside of Milan. Its focus? Soil. The team plants a variety of grains and seeds, which help pump nutrients back into the earth. Non-invasive techniques like  composting and adopting low- or no-till practices also minimise soil disruption.\n\n\u2018Farmers are the gatekeepers of the health of our soils: the most important foundation of a healthy farm ecosystem,\u2019 founder and CEO of Miscusi, Alberto Cartasegna, says. \u2018Good soil-health practices can truly help combat climate change from the ground up.\u2019\n\nMiscusi is opening its first restaurant outside of Italy in December, right here in Covent Garden. All dishes will feature seasonal ingredients, grown with organic farming techniques, and will be created with a nutritionist to reduce food carbon footprint so they can guide them on how to keeping with carbon emissions, water, and biodiversity impact for all the ingredients in mind. The restaurant will also be breaking ground by introducing an industry-first loyalty scheme that will reward diners for making food choices that are friendlier to the planet. As if we needed another reason to eat good pasta.\n\n\u200b\u200b23 Slingsby Place in The Yards, Covent Garden, WC2E 9AB\n\nPhotograph: Edward-Howell-Photography\nPhotograph: Edward-Howell-Photography\n2. Eating seasonally is the way forward\n\nNew restaurant Warehouse is going to be big in size \u2013 a whopping 2,000 square feet \u2013 but also big on sustainability. The plan is to provide seasonal food while supporting local suppliers. \u2018If a menu stays the same all year round, it is not sustainable, because all you\u2019re doing is mass-producing certain ingredients and not capitalising on fresh, local produce,\u2019 Warehouse\u2019s explains head chef Brendan Eades, who previously ran the kitchen at trailblazing zero-waste restaurant Silo. \u2018Our menu will listen to the seasons. It takes flexibility. I\u2019ll see things available from my produce suppliers one week and the next week they\u2019re gone.\u2019 The restaurant\u2019s sustainability efforts go beyond food: its interiors will use natural materials and reclaimed furniture throughout. \u2018If we don\u2019t change now, there will be no future,\u2019 Eades adds. \u2018That is really what it comes down to, because the industry is not sustainable as it is. Change is urgent and it needs to come from everyone.\u2019\n\n6 Langley Street, WC2H 9JA\n\nPhotograph: Native\nPhotograph: Native\n3. It\u2019s time to get into foraging\n\nYou can go wild at Native. Not in a raging three-day bender kind of way, but in terms of what you eat. Founders Ivan Tisdall-Downes and Imogen Davis have created a restaurant that celebrates wild, foraged food, with hyperlocal British seasonal and sustainable cooking at its core. They incorporate game, unorthodox meat and fish dishes, like fallow deer haunch and Cornish hake, and carefully selected herbs, plants and vegetables into their dishes. The best thing to order? The Chefs\u2019 Wasting Snacks, a selection of nibbles, like hen of the woods fungus with aquafaba smoke emulsion or squash, chermoula and tamari seeds, created using ingredients that would otherwise be destined for the tip. Also, a voluntary \u00a31 donation is added to every bill which goes to Farms for City Children, a charity that enables kids from disadvantaged inner-city communities to experience farm and countryside life.\n\n39 Brook St, W1K 4JE \n\nFin and Flounder Seafood Shack\nPhotograph: Justin De Souza\n4. You should probably find out how your fish is caught\n\nHackney fishmonger Fin and Flounder is one of the few businesses leading a change in the fishing industry. Instead of farm-raised and imported, it opts for fish caught via small boats and in-shore vessels. These use gear like pots, traps and fixed nets, which have a much smaller environmental impact compared to commercial fishing methods like bottom trawling, where nets are dragged along the seabed, destroying it. It\u2019s no wonder that this family-run company has become one of the most trusted wholesale fish suppliers to some of London\u2019s best restaurants, including Bright, Rochelle Canteen and The Clove Club. \u2018As a rough guide to buying fish sustainably, always buy locally and seasonally, and eat fewer big, predatory fish,\u2019 Fin and Flounder shop manager Mike Harrison explains. \u2018Shellfish (clams, mussels, hand-dived scallops, potted crabs and lobster) are a very sustainable option due to their abundance and position in the food chain. Avoid imported fish and try some of the lesser appreciated species like plaice, flounder, spider crab or whiting.\u2019 If you want a good quality catch of the day cooked fresh in front of you, head to Bar Flounder, the fishmonger\u2019s new seafood shack in Netil Market, just around the corner from its shop.\n\n71 Broadway Market, E8 4PH\n\nPhotograph: Petersham Nurseries\nPhotograph: Petersham Nurseries\n5. Composting is cool\n\nAs well as being an Instagrammer honeytrap, Petersham Nurseries is in tune with nature and treats it with the utmost respect. Founded by Gael and Francesco Boglione, it\u2019s long been an advocate of organic farming. Its on-site kitchen garden and plant nursery grow ingredients in a chemical-free way and it sources produce directly from the owners\u2019 family farm in Devon. Slow food is the aim of the game, with the chefs sticking firmly to seasonal vegetables and fruits that travel as short a distance as possible (to cut down the energy needed to get them on to tables). Sustainability informs every aspect of the flagship Richmond restaurant: from the catering supplies to the uniform, everything has been picked for its eco credentials. \u2018The kitchen uses greaseproof paper made from sustainable forests, 100 percent compostable and recyclable, and chef jackets are made from recycled bottles,\u2019 says managing director Lara Boglione. \u2018Our vegetable prep, coffee and tea waste are sent to our on-site compost. This is used throughout the nursery and kitchen gardens and helps us to grow the wonderful flowers in our cutting garden.\u2019\n\nChurch Lane, Petersham Rd, Church Lane TW10 7AB\n\nPhotograph: Hill & Szrok\nPhotograph: Hill & Szrok\n6. If you\u2019re going to do meat, do it the old-fashioned way\n\nBy day Hill & Szrok is a little meat shop that specialises in small-herd and whole-carcass butchery. By night it\u2019s a neighbourhood restaurant using local and seasonal produce, which has a no-bookings policy and a big communal table where chefs serve up leftover meat from the day\u2019s trade until it\u2019s gone. This place isn\u2019t your run-of-the-mill butcher, it\u2019s serious about its sourcing policy and traceability. It no longer buys animals from abattoirs and prioritises local producers, ensuring they\u2019re paid properly and put animal welfare first. \u2018We haven\u2019t reinvented the wheel. We\u2019re going back to how things used to be, by taking away options and only selling what\u2019s available,\u2019 Luca Mathiszig-Lee, co-founder of Hill & Szrok, explains. \u2018[We\u2019ve gone] from having everything the customer wants to now not having what the customer wants. It\u2019s a risk, and we\u2019re more expensive than our competitors, but it\u2019s important to stock seasonally to prevent food waste.\u2019\n\nWhile some people argue that ditching meat and fish all together is the only way to eat sustainably, Mathiszig-Lee thinks there\u2019s a middle ground. \u2018People come to us because of what we stand for and what we do. We\u2019ve actually had people who haven\u2019t eaten meat for five years coming in,\u2019 he adds. \u2018I\u2019m not telling people \u201cdon\u2019t be vegan or vegetarian\u201d, but if you\u2019re not conscious about where food comes from you\u2019re no different from someone who eats meat.\u2019 Keep your eyes peeled for more from Hill & Szrok because it\u2019s opening a second site in Newington Green in November called Stella\u2019s (named after Mathiszig-Lee\u2019s dog), which will have a cookshop and bar element to it.",

        "text": "Muse \n Our suppliers \n\n HG Walter\nHG Walter are an independent family-run butcher, committed to changing the way people eat meat. Established in 1972 by Peter Heanen, they have become one of London\u2019s most respected butchers, supplying some of the best chefs, restaurants and loyal customers with the very best of British meat, rating highly in provenance, welfare, and flavour. Their meat is predominantly sourced from small farms rearing free-range native breeds. These native breeds, such as Hereford and Aberdeen Angus cattle and Hampshire Duroc pigs, are known for yielding the best meat in the world, their natural diets and slow growth producing excellent marbling and fat content, allowing a superior depth of flavour. Sustainability is also a priority among their farmers \u2013 livestock on these farms contribute to a biodiverse landscape contrary to the destructive nature associated with much larger scale farms.\n\nLake District Farmers\nLake District Farmers\nLake District Farmers work with over 50 Cumbrian farms. With a strong team around them, Dan, Hayden and Sales Director, Russell Dodd, are able to continue to nurture the relationships they have established with the LDF farmers and their animals. These relationships have been, and still are, crucial in enabling LDF to become synonymous with producing some of the best quality, breed specific meat available. With quality being the LDF byword, it has been crucial to scale up the business slowly so that the core elements of the LDF ethos are not lost. This has been key in enabling the company to develop a customer portfolio that includes some of the UK\u2019s best chefs, restauranteurs and hotels. LDF remains closely connected to the people and landscape that produce, rear and raise their stock, being alongside them every step of the way. This ensures that the LDF team unequivocally understand the level of passion, patience and good solid hard work that goes into creating a second-to-none product. This connection and dedication to their farmers enables LDF to play a major part in protecting a long-standing way of life that is becoming increasingly rare, whilst supplying top quality produce to top quality customers \u2013 the perfect equation to protect and preserve traditional fell farming for generations to come.\n\nBoat on water\nFlying Fish\nWe are lucky to have access to the richest and most varied fish and shellfish stocks in the UK, if not the world, right here on our doorstep. Flying Fish suppliers use their specialist local knowledge, skill and hard graft to bring us beautiful fish from the ship to our restaurant in 48 hours, or less. The Atlantic supplies wild fish all year round, so Flying Fish choose the best of what\u2019s in season. They want our children\u2019s children to enjoy the ample stocks of seafood we have now, so they buy from day boats run by responsible fishermen only.\n\nKeltic Seafare\nKeltic Seafare\nKeltic Seafare supply premium live seafood, namely hand-dived scallops, creel caught langoustine and native lobster, all sourced daily in fresh pristine Scottish waters. With a prestigious customer base - quality is always paramount! All their shellfish is sourced from crystal clear \u2018Class A\u2019 waters off the North-West Highland Coast of Scotland. Their dedicated and hardy fishermen strive to bring us the best the seas can offer, whatever the weather. \n\nHodmedods\nHodmedods\nHodmedod is a company based in Suffolk in the small charming town of Beccles. The name reflects the words East Anglian background and represents part of the forgotten heritage of the indigenous pulse, grains and beans. They work with amazing organic farmers and farms around East Anglia, all promoting sustainability with organic growing. They supply a whole host of grains and pulses. Many of the farms that are supplying Hodmedods are in and around Norfolk.\n\nShipton Mill\nShipton Mill\nSet in a beautiful Cotswold valley near Tetbury, the mill in Shipton Moyne Wood has been producing flour since the time of the Domesday Book. Today it produces a wide variety of speciality flours, using both traditional grain and traditional methods. The grain ground at Shipton Mill provides flours that are unsurpassed in texture and flavour and have built a well-earned reputation among professional, artisan and home-bakers all over the country. Shipton Mill source exceptional grains, both home-grown varieties (such as Maris Widgeon) and offerings from agricultural lands all around the world. It is with Shipton Mill that we are able to produce the most incerdible sourdough for all our guests at Muse. \n\nNurtured In Norfolk\nNurtured In Norfolk\nAllan and Sue Miller both worked full time as chefs for 20 years before becoming growers of Micro Cress. Their transition from one profession to another was brought about by the need for a more consistent product. They decided to grow cress themselves in a small greenhouse in their back garden and began supplying the restaurant they worked in. Their experience has helped them tremendously in understanding the requirements of chefs. Having successfully grown Micro Cress for use in the restaurant, with very positive feedback, they were asked by a wholesaler if they were able to grow in a larger volume. Allan and Sue decided to invest their time and money into their business, which is when \u2018Nurtured in Norfolk\u2019 really began. Allan and Sue chose micro herbs that where strong in flavour and still looked appealing on the plate with varieties that are most popular because of their robust flavour like coriander, lemon balm, baby mint, ruby frills mustard, fennel, garlic chives, red vein sorrel and basil are still by far the most popular to date. The range of micro cress has now been extended to over 70 different types. All together there are over 280 different edibles in the range. Now 10 years on in a 4-acre nursery the business has gone from strength to strength, with the help and support of numerous wholesalers. A work force of 60 plus fulltime committed staff now produce a niche range to keep up with the ever-growing demand for new, unique and innovative products. Constantly growing and developing as a company \u2018Nurtured in Norfolk\u2019 now supply a range of wholesalers and Michelin star restaurants with a top-quality selection of cut Micro Cress, Pea Shoots, Edible Flowers, Baby, Micro and Sea Vegetables and Edible Leaves in various flavours. As you will see from a few pictures there is a huge amount of produce, all of a very high quality. The glasshouses as well are huge that are heated in the winter, so they can carry on growing through the winter and as they enter the summer they will then need a little cooler air. As ex chefs, Allan and Sue\u2019s simple ethos is that the quality and consistency of the product has to be of an exacting standard that they would have expected and been happy to use themselves. All the products have been grown on a natural soil base that is of a high quality benefiting from nutrients that are present throughout the growing stages and therefore extending the shelf life. Biological controls are used throughout the growing process to keep the crops clean and pest free and so making sure that all the crops have the most flavour and being micro they certainly do pack a punch.\n\n \n\nOld Hall Farm\nOld Hall Farm\nOld hall farm is a beautiful farm in Suffolk near the town of Bungay. The Mayhew family have been farming in Woodton since the mid 1940's, and started out with a small suckler cow herd, chickens for egg production, and pig rearing, as well as farming over 500 acres of arable land. Whilst on a family holiday in 2016, Stuart and Rebecca Mayhew spent time on a friend's dairy unit in Scotland and fell in love with the idea of having their own herd of Jersey cattle. Their first cow, Freya arrived in November 2016 and they haven't looked back since. The cows milk once a day, in the morning, and this means that the calves has ample opportunity to get the milk it needs from its mother throughout the rest of the day. The benefits of keeping cows and calves together are vast, but essentially, it's best for the calf and its mother, and it allows for a more symbiotic relationship between cow and human. I can vouch for that as I have never seen such friendly cows as these beautiful Hersey cows, they all have their own names, which they of course all answer to and will come and give you a friendly nudge to show they heard you. Whilst me and the team were visiting the farm, we were lucky enough to see some baby calves which were only a few hours old, I don\u2019t think that I have witnessed anything cuter than these calves. Stuart and Rebecca produce amazing raw milk products from cream to butter to milkshakes. This is where we use their wonderful thick cream and milk for one of our course just down the road on the tasting menu , as from my family home of where I used to live in Cringleford which is just outside Norwich in Norfolk, its only 20 minutes away, hence the name. We also make our own cultured butter from their cream which we make each morning for the restaurant to serve alongside our homemade sour dough bread.\n\nCombine Harvester\nBarsham Brewery\nThe West Barsham Estate in North Norfolk is home to the Barsham Brewery. Susanna Soames\u2019s family have owned and farmed the land here for generations. In an area renowned for its top-quality agricultural soil, North Norfolk\u2019s sea air and unique micro-climate, they are able to poduce some of the best malting barley in the world. This brewery is only 20 minutes away from Blakeney on the North Norfolk coast, which was a little seaside village we would always go to as kids, it\u2019s a beautiful part of the Norfolk coastline. The small team of 3 spend almost a year nurturing and growing a wide range of crops, from sugar beet to oil seed rape, wheat, vining peas and barley. When the summer arrives their team embark upon the annual tradition of harvesting. Come rain or shine, darkness or light, using a combination of traditional and modern techniques, the job gets done in time for the arrival of Autumn. The Maris Otter Barley is malted down the road at Crisp Maltings and returned to the state of the art brewery situated within one of the Estate\u2019s ancient farm buildings. The malt is blended with beautifully pure water from their own bore hole and hop varieties from around the world to craft a collection of very local beers - \u201cNorfolk born and brewed\u201d. Their home and heritage run through each and every part of their business. Their signature blue and brown bottles are inspired by Susanna\u2019s Great Grandfather\u2019s racing colours from his days as a successful racehorse owner in the 1930\u2019s, and their beers are now named after significant places and personalities (human and animal!) that have marked life on the West Barsham estate for over 100 years. We use their stout beer Robin Stout in Muse\u2019s sour dough to give it a final twist of flavour along with the four types of flour and treacle.\n\nRare Tea Company\nRare Tea Company\nThe Rare Tea Company was founded in 2004, by Henrietta Lovell (known as the Tea Lady), to source and supply the world's best tea - direct from farmers and their tea gardens. The aim is to benefit both the people who craft the tea and their customers who drink it. It is their goal to help tea gardens flourish like vineyards, and for customers to appreciate tea like fine wine. Good tea may cost a little more but the difference is worth every penny. All of their tea is crafted by skilled men and women on independent farms for the best flavour, not the cheapest price. They travel the world to seek out the best teas. Unique terroirs, direct trade and sustainability make up the three cornerstones of their business; their ambition is to redefine what good tea means and must meet three criteria:\n\nIt has to taste good. Well, better than good. It has to taste amazing.\nIt has to be good for you. No pesticides, herbicides, additives, flavourings, or bags with bleaches, glues and microplastics.\nIt has to be good for the people who make it. They pay the best prices for the best tea so that the communities we work with might thrive.",

Established in 1972 by Peter Heanen, we have become one of London\u2019s most respected butchers, supplying some of the best chefs and restaurants, and of course our loyal customers, with the very best of British meat rating highly in provenance, welfare, and flavour.\nPeter Heanen with top UK chefs at Petersham Nurseries\nOur shop is in Barons Court, where our friendly service, passion for good food, and combined years of expertise help customers get the best out of their meat, whatever their requirements. We are extremely proud of how far we have come and continue to strive towards not being the biggest but being the best.\n\nOur meat is predominantly sourced from small farms rearing free-range native breeds. These native breeds, such as Hereford and Aberdeen Angus cattle and Hampshire Duroc pigs, are known for yielding the best meat in the world, their natural diets and slow growth producing excellent marbling and fat content, allowing a superior depth of flavour. Sustainability is also a priority among our farmers \u2013 livestock on these farms contribute to a biodiverse landscape contrary to the destructive nature associated with much larger scale farms.\n\nThe Heanens family owners of HG Walter\nA devotion to supplying products of the highest quality means we sometimes look further afield however, whether it\u2019s acorn fed Ib\u00e9rico pork reared on our friend Redondo Iglesias\u2019 family farm in Estremadura, or Dutch veal from Peter\u2019s Farm, who\u2019s welfare standards are second to none.\n\nWe pride ourselves on having the best beef in the UK, intensifying its natural flavour, by dry ageing for a minimum of 28 days and up to 90 days in our custom-made Himalayan salt room. Our chefs prepare all our pies, scotch eggs, stocks, burgers, and sausages in-house. From the Michelin-Starred River Caf\u00e9 to the highly acclaimed Kricket, our meat and pantry products supply hundreds of restaurants, and we are the go-to butcher for many of London\u2019s food writers, chefs, and critics. We\u2019ve never tried to be the biggest, only the best, while holding our values close in everything we do.",

I|\nDishes will include raw Carmarthen prawns with wild asparagus; braised peas with cockles; wood-grilled lamb chops; and lobster caldereta, a braised lobster dish from Menorca.\nSupporting dishes will include wood-fired rice and smoked potatoes.\n\"Caldereta, amongst others on the menu is the type of food I find hugely transportive and deeply satisfying to eat,\" says Parry. \"I've always loved walking by the windows of Soho restaurant institutions catching glimpses of tables which began at lunch and are now threatening to roll into dinner. I can't wait for guests to eat these dishes and share in these moments, watching the world go past the windows at Mountain.\"\nVermouth made in Sicily for Mountain by Salvatore Marino will be poured from tap with other drinks including blood orange Garibaldis and a selection of spritzes made with citrus fruits from the Todoli Foundation in Valencia.\nA different approach to the wine list has been developed in collaboration with wine supplier Keeling Andrew & Co with the list focused on a dozen or so winemakers that are meaningful to the restaurant and whose wines reflect the 'mountain and sea' inspiration in the kitchen.\nDesign details will include large windows the length of the building, a huge counter bar made of English elm and an open kitchen that merges with the dining room.",

Sustainability means ensuring the long-term futures of the wonderful producers we rely on.   \nOUR FISH AND FARM\n\nAt the end of last year and the start of 2023 we started two similar initiatives that we hope will change the way local restaurants and producers interact in Margate and the wider area, and in doing so, help secure the long-term futures of two of our wonderful producers.\n\nTOM\n\nTom is the youngest boat owner in the slowly dwindling Ramsgate fishing fleet. We have partnered with him in order to buy fresh, locally caught seafood direct from his boat. This initiative has a dual purpose, getting both sustainable day-boat fish with the most traceable provenance and, just as importantly, offering a different economic model for Tom and help him work directly with people and business\u2019 in the local area. This system allows Tom to receive a fixed higher price for his/her catch, removing the instability of selling only to intermediaries and the price fluctuations that come with it.\n\nThis project was initiated by Angela's and it has proven to be very successful for us both, and we are now helping other restaurants in Margate to do the same. This allows Tom to make a more sustainable long-term living by ensuring if something happens to one restaurant, he is still able to sell directly to other restaurants, spreading the risk.\n\nSelling direct to restaurants and consumers may seem like normal practice in places like Cornwall where there are bigger fleets that are directly accessible, but in Ramsgate and in many other smaller fleets around the country, this is not happening. We would like to see this replicated in many more areas and help, even if it is just a little, in reviving ever shrinking fleets that are so important to our coastline and communities.\nScreenshot 2023-05-15 at 18.35.00.png\n\nJACK\n\nJack is an agricultural student and now our head grower. We have partnered with him, and Nonnington Farm just outside Canterbury, in order to grow vegetables that are farmed with the utmost respect for the soil and provide a young, talented grower with the opportunity to create a long-term sustainable business. \n\nJack started growing on a small piece of land directly outside his house, and after a chance conversation with his Dad (our local roadsweeper), we tried some of his wonderful home-grown produce - needless to say his never-ending quest for better soils and outstanding vegetables won us over. So when Jack met the wonderful James and Emma at Nonnington Farms and suggested a partnership we jumped at the chance to create a new way for us to work. We now have two acres of land that will provide produce for the restaurant, which in turn allow us to reduce our plastic and our reliance on transporting vegetables from further afield. \n\nThe idea is to grow each year to produce more for our restaurant but also to allow Jack to widen his business to ensure his long term viability. Much like working with Tom, this is not for us to hide our suppliers, it is for us to share them with the local area and help provide a more sustainable way of working for us all.\n\n",

Together they started this full carcass butchery, supplying regeneratively produced meats of the highest quality but the lowest impact. \n \nToday, their small but growing team consists of many forward-thinking people with interesting life experiences who bring fresh thinking to the industry, such as an ex-environmental lawyer turned butcher, the former CEO of Vice Media, and the ex-Photo Director of Men\u2019s Fitness magazine. All equally passionate about food and the environment, they\u2019re excited to make a real difference to both the health and wellbeing of their customers and the landscape of the UK by encouraging more farmers to farm in nature-friendly, biodiverse, and regenerative ways. \nThe name was originally a working title, but it stuck. And the team are proud that it holds them accountable for their actions. They\u2019re completely transparent about their supply chain and consider sustainability in each aspect of the business, from the staff contracts to transport and packaging, continuously reassessing the impact of all their suppliers. They\u2019re even using a proportion of their profits to train more farmers in regenerative farming techniques.\n \nThrough this consistent and passionate work, The Ethical Butcher is educating customers in how to enjoy meat in a well balanced way and dispelling myths around the potential impact of meat production in the UK. \nThe Ethical Butcher.jpg\nApricity Behind the scenes - fabric unrolling.jpeg\nGUNG HO\n\u200b\nSophie Dunster started Gung Ho to get people talking about important issues through the conversations we have about our wardrobes. \n\u200b\nShe designed sustainable, adaptable clothing in her studio in a shipping container in Battersea until 2023 when the decision was made to cease production, amidst increased cost of living and production costs. Whilst in production, Gung Ho's fabrics were printed in Gloucestershire and each item made locally in London, supporting small businesses. Each design was based on colourful prints packed with meaning around a particular issue. And every piece a conversation starter - walking artworks to get people talking about their passions.\n\u200b\nWe met Sophie during her 2019 Food for Thought campaign addressing the impact food has on our planet. Chantelle went to try something on and found out that Sophie was booked into Tredwells later that week. They became friends, joining forces to lead educational supper clubs. Since then, we\u2019ve been lucky to have Sophie design and make the uniforms for Tredwells, All\u2019s Well, and now Apricity.\nUsing sustainable fabrics, each Gung Ho item was cleverly designed to avoid waste during production. And by designing the clothing to be size-adjustable, Sophie was able to extend each garment's life cycle. Leftover fabric was used for smaller items and fed into Gung Ho Reworked \u2013 including one-of-a-kind furniture pieces and upcycled vintage garments.\n\u200b\nGung Ho also challenged the way the fashion industry works by launching a bespoke made-to-order collection, aiming to reduce stock waste via pre-ordered monthly batches. To make this possible they collaborated with other London makers and their customers, bringing everyone together and giving their customers more choice. \n\u200b\u200b\nThe name stems from being \u2018gung ho\u2019 - acting with raw enthusiasm and attitude. And we think Sophie is just that. Engaging and inspiring people in a positive way to be part of the solution, despite no longer operating as a fashion supplier, out team still proudly wear their Gung Ho uniforms and we will forever remain a whole hearted supporter of the work Sophie does. \nApricity Behind the scenes - ironing.jpeg\nTHE SEA, THE SEA\n\u200b\nInspired by the line \"La mer, la mer toujours recommenc\u00e9e\" (The sea, the sea every day re-starting) from a poem by Paul Valery, this pioneering seafood merchant shares the sea\u2019s fresh new bounty every day with shops, restaurants, and customers in an exciting and sustainable way.\n\u200b\nWith a shared love of the incredible variety of fish around our native shores, the team began a mission to promote the full range of species available to UK customers. By working with restaurant partners, and selling through their own shops and restaurants, they\u2019re making sure this local produce is enjoyed here in the UK and not lost to countries who recognise its quality better than we have done in the past.\n\u200b\nThey\u2019ve built a strong relationship with some of the best fishermen in Devon, Cornwall, and Scotland. The wild, UK-caught produce comes straight off these local day-boats into The Sea, The Sea\u2019s own transport, meaning the fish can be delivered within 24 hours of being caught.\n\u200b\n \nPlus - there\u2019s no middle man. That way they can be completely sure of the quality of catch going into their shops and restaurants, and ours, and remain totally transparent with their customers. \n\u200b\nThey work closely with the fishermen and external consultants to make sure they\u2019re working as sustainably as possible, and always refer to official bodies such as MSC and Seafish. They\u2019ve also developed their own sustainability policy to make sure they go above and beyond. \n \nAs both a supplier and a restaurant owner themselves, The Sea, The Sea understands every side of the restaurant business and perfectly supports our mission at Apricity. It\u2019s a pleasure to work with a team who shares our desire to show love and respect for the bounty of the sea through progressive, produce-led, seasonal cooking.\nRoebuck Estates (5).jpeg\nROEBUCK ESTATES\n\u200b\nChantelle first met Will Hine from Roebuck Estates when she was managing The Gilbert Scott. The team has since tried many bottles together and enjoyed a tour of the vineyard in Sussex.\n\u200b\nRoebuck Estates was started in 2013 by two friends, Michael Smith and John Ball, with a passion for great wine. They knew that England, with its climate and soils, had the potential to produce world-beating sparkling wines. So, together they found the perfect site to start their own vineyard. Now, their experienced crew use their wealth of knowledge to grow the finest fruit across multiple sites, producing quality, characterful sparkling wine. After almost 10 years they\u2019re still reaching new audiences, helping people realise the quality of the wine produced on our doorstep.\nAlong with their name, the wines are inspired by the Roebuck deer that roam the vineyards \u2013 nimble, elegant, and at one with their environment. So, naturally, sustainability is important to the team.\n \nThey\u2019re also proud to be one of the founding members of the Sustainable Wines of Great Britain (SWGB) certification scheme which is driving the development of sustainability in UK viticulture. Roebuck Estates understand that keeping their vines happy and healthy through sustainable viticulture helps deliver a delicious bottle of sparkling wine.\n\u200b\nWill says, \u201cworking with Chantelle is always a joy. Having such a champion is a great reinforcement that keeping sustainability at the heart of what you do not only feels instinctively the right way to look after your land and vineyards but also enhances the quality of the final product\u201d.\n2014 CC, 2016 RDN, 2015 BDN - Black.jpeg\nSHRUB LONDON\u200b\n \nStarting a business supplying restaurants in a pandemic could have ended very differently for Shrub. But with a background in catering, farming, and food supply chains, Sam and Harry noticed UK restaurants weren\u2019t getting the high-quality, ethically-sourced fruit and veg they deserved. Determined to provide better, they quit their jobs, hired a van, and started Shrub.\n\u200b\nChantelle was one of their very first customers, and in 2020, Shrub began to supply Tredwells with their sustainable and integrity-driven fruit and veg, sourced directly from UK farms. Now we\u2019re thrilled to have them supplying Apricity.\nAlong with other Shrub customers, by choosing them we\u2019re increasing the demand for a better standard of agriculture, encouraging farmers to convert currently damaging farming practices into more regenerative ones. \n\u200b\nWhat\u2019s more, with our focus on celebrating UK vegetables and looking after people, we know that thanks to Shrub, the farmers who do so much for our planet and our plates are given the recognition they deserve. The more we value our farmers, the more they'll value us and the planet. And every time we order from Shrub, whether it\u2019s rare fungi or a humble potato, we know the produce is sourced to the highest standard while also having a positive impact on our food production industry. \nScreenshot 2023-11-29 171956.png\nNAMAYASAI FARM\n\u200b\nEstablished in 2005, Namayasai are Natural Agriculture\u2122 growers of English and Japanese vegetables herbs and fruit.\n\nBased in Lewes, East Sussex, Namayasai were among the first growers in the UK to pioneer the agroforestry method known as 'alley cropping' and to attempt to use conservation biological control in a commercial free-of-subsidy setting. After 18 years they still use no pesticides, no fungicides and no herbicides - not even the approved organic chemicals. From bare fields, in 13 years nature has created a 21-acre self-seeded woodland of willow, oak, hornbeam, aspen and ash - several thousand trees, none planted by man or woman.\n\u200b\nThe vast majority of Namayasai's crops are grown outside for a nutrition and flavour boost from nature's harsh environment. Although their 'slow-food' methods mean a shorter growing season the result is a taste second to none and a shelf-life many times longer than the majority of shop or wholesaler-sourced produce.  Their pre-dawn harvests ensure customers receive produce that is only 2 to 12 hours from being picked, this freshness again ensuring maximum nutrition, taste and shelf-life.\n\u200b\nFrom ashitaba to yuzu, alehoof to wild carrots, Namayasai grow a wide range of English and Japanese vegetables together with an increasing variety of fruit. In 2016 they produced their first crop of yuzu and we at Apricity delight in being able to offer it as part of our menu, knowing it's been grown and harvested locally with the utmost care. \n20200421_131104.jpg\nRENEGADE URBAN WINERY\n\u200b\nRenegade shares our ethos of creating excellent results by building happy teams who have fun! \n\u200b\n\u201cBreaking the rules, one bottle at a time\u201d, they source brilliantly grown grapes from partner vineyards across the UK and Europe. After harvesting by hand, they bring the grapes back to their warehouse in Walthamstow - by road, not plane. Here, they experiment with a mix of new and ancient production methods to make small batches of wines for modern, curious palettes. All without using chemicals or industrial processes.\n\u200b\nIn fact, if you time your visit to the winery to coincide with a delivery of grapes you may be roped into some grape squishing-yourself \u2013 using just your bare feet. Our own team has been known to get involved on a few occasions!\nOnce processed, leftover squashed grapes are donated to breweries and distilleries to be used in their fermentation and distillation processes, so nothing is wasted. And though they\u2019re already plastic-free, Renegade is further pushing the boundaries of how wine is traditionally packaged, experimenting with kegs and wine in cans for even less environmental impact.\n\u200b\nHaving been disrupting the traditional wine world for just over five years, we\u2019re proud to have worked with them for four of those. And we\u2019re thrilled to now be able to bring you their innovative, unique, and mouth-watering wines to enjoy alongside your meal at Apricity. \n20210925_175751.jpg\nCOS.png\nCITIZENS OF SOIL\n\u200b\nWhen the team behind Citizens of Soil first started to learn more about olive oil, they saw an industry fraught with issues, including a dangerous lack of transparency and anonymised mass production. Overly commoditised, independent farmers often cannot make enough money from their harvests, the oil changes hands multiple times on the journey between farm and table, and the final oil in our pantries ends up an old, flat, and flavourless shadow of what it once was. Citizens of Soil began in order to break that chain and offer their customers a taste of something they'd never had the chance to taste before.\n\u200b\nThey set out to champion small-scale farmers and shed a light on the things they produce. They pay their producers above market prices, and directly into their pockets. This way grove owners can focus on the quality of the oil and continue to implement regenerative farming techniques to preserve biodiversity and soil quality.\nIMG_8421.JPG\n58 AND CO.\n\u200b\nWe met Carmen O\u2019Neil, owner of 58 and Co., at Renegade Winery in 2021 and have since become good friends with a shared love of excellent food and drink, and of course, sustainability. \n \nIn 2016, Carmen was forced to abandon the launch of her designer bridal shoe business at the last moment when a tragic accident left her unable to draw. But, determined not to be beaten, and desperate to start a business with purpose, she turned to happy childhood memories of her mother distilling essential oils. Fascinated by the power of distillation, she decided to distil world-class spirits that also happened to be sustainable, and 58 and Co. was born.\n \nJust five years later, it\u2019s the first female-owned B Corp spirit producer in the country. The collection, which began with gin (her mother\u2019s favourite tipple) and now also includes vodka, has won numerous awards and even been praised by Forbes magazine. All this, produced in the same kind of still her mum used when she was a child (named after her for good measure) in a railway arch under the London Overground. \nCarmen shows that you can be sustainable even when space is an issue. Unable to grow their own wheat in central London, they buy British wheat ethanol produced just 30 miles from the distillery. The still runs on solar energy, the driveway is built from 141000 plastic straws diverted from the ocean, and their takeaway canvas bags are made from the salvaged waste cuttings from organic cotton clothing production blended with plastic bottles. \n \nLike us, Carmen is on a mission to reduce waste. The spent botanicals are sent back to the farm to be recycled into compost in a completely circular system. And to produce their Apple & Hibiscus gin, they use apples that have been rejected by supermarkets and would otherwise go to waste. But not content with giving these apples one life, instead of being composted once they come out of the vapour basket, the gin-infused apple mulch is sent to Humble Crumble to make apple and gin crumble. \n \nWe\u2019re excited to be adding their gin to our menu here at Apricity. 58 and Co.\u2019s success is proof that sustainability doesn\u2019t have to mean compromise, and that a product can be one of the best on the market while happening to be ethical and sustainable.\nIMG_8442.jpg\nMerit.png\nMERIT FARM MUSHROOMS  \n \nMerit Mushrooms is a small, quality-focused gourmet mushroom producer that used natural products to grow fresh mushrooms locally in Elstree, London. \n\u200b\nBlack pearl, yellow oyster and maitake mushrooms are mainstays on our menu as part of our ever popular mushroom mains dish, cutting a striking figure on the plate in all their ever beautiful and organic forms. \n",

        "text": "Inver Restaurant: Briefly, We Are Transported\nUpdated: Sep 30, 2021\nSaturday 19th September 2020\n\n\u201cAre you having the tasting\u201d the owner of the B and B asks, a glimmer of excitement in his eyes. We confirm that we are. \u201cOhh, you\u2019re in for a treat,\u201d he says, rubbing his hands together. \nWhen John, the local (the only?) taxi-driver, picks us up later, he too asks if we\u2019re \u201chaving the tasting\u201d, with the same flash of joy mingled with pride in his eyes. \u201cTake as long as you like. Really just enjoy it,\u201d he urges us. Much like all of my holidays, this trip has been planned around where we will eat. Having travelled to this corner of Scotland with the expressed interest of eating at Inver, we are buoyed to hear such gushing sentiments from the locals. \n\n\n\nAt the restaurant we are shown straight into the bar area where our meal begins. In front of the low fire, we peruse the cocktail menu which is neither lengthy nor intimidating, reasonably priced too. I opt for the cocktail from the specials board: rosehip syrup, lime and tequila, and my partner has a negroni. In addition to our drinks, we are also given our first taste of the meal to come whilst seated in the bar. The waitress brings over a tray of four different snacks which form the first course of the tasting menu: raw vegetables and anchovy, cockles, tattie scones and grilles slice, and tomato leaf tart. Immediately what strikes me is the delicate use of flowers and herbs on each morsel, both as decorative garnish and for flavour. Take the cockles: served in their own intensely flavoured juices which appeared to have been slightly jellified, there was a strong burst of citrus too, along with the subtle floral spice of the fennel pollen that had been used to garnish each cockle individually. Perhaps it\u2019s the signature touch of Pam, the head chef, or perhaps it\u2019s part of the restaurants\u2019 love letter to the Scottich countryside. Sorrel root and lemon cucumber were some of the other interesting produce to feature amongst the crudites. \n\n\nSnacks finished, cocktail glasses drained, we are now seated comfortably at our table, we are able to fully appreciate our surroundings. There\u2019s a slight change of gear between the atmosphere of the bar and the restaurant. Whereas the bar is dimly lit with up-lighters on the walls and the furnishings are dark and soft, the restaurant area has brighter spotlights, bright white walls and the wooden tables and chairs have been left unpainted. The exposed wood and the more stark lighting gives the feeling of being a little more exposed. Little touches such as mis-matched vintage glassware, old books, and tiny glass bottles on the windowsill filled with seasonal blooms help soften the edges. The mix of comfort and harshness in the decor seems to emulate the Scottish countryside and coastline that is evidently so much part of this restaurant\u2019s bones.\n\n\n\nThe obligatory sourdough and homemade butter grace our table along with the first course: Squash broth. Rob, the sommelier and co-owner of the restaurant, informs us that the broth has been made using the earthy, caramel pan juices of roasted squash and enriched with pork fat. Now, I am likely to go weak in the knees for anything that is enriched with pork fat. Far from making the sweet broth feel greasy, the fat gives the broth body in the mouth, making it feel so rich and so savoury that a tiny cup is all you need to feel completely nourished.\n\n\n\nAlready feeling pretty content with our lot, things perk up even more when Rob pops back to the table to pour our first glass of wine from the recommended pairing. Le Campore is a white wine from Emilia-Romagna in Italy. Skin contact in its first stage of fermentation, before spending a little time in oak, this wine has all the character I would expect to find in a skin contact wine - which, truth be told, I\u2019m not entirely convinced I like. Lots of citrus with an earthy \u201cforest floor\u201d musk to it. Swiftly after, its partner dish joins us at the table: corncob custard with chanterelles and fresh cheese. Immediately it\u2019s clear to see how the sweet, earthy chanterelles and corn have come into partnership with this wine. I'm still not sure how I feel about set custards - I find that the texture is just a bit odd - but blackberries and thyme flowers make a surprising addition to this dish, creating that sense of the forest in every bite. \n\nNext we have the fish course. Being right on the water, it\u2019s almost a given that Inver would be offering exceptional fresh fish, and of course they are. The mackerel dish was perhaps my favourite. Its flavours, colours and textures are so clean and vibrant. The fish, just lightly cured, was exceptional but the most interesting thing on the plate was electric green sauce made from apple marigold. Once again, the use of flowers in the presentation and flavour of a dish really makes an impact. We are poured a glass of A Pedreira, Albarino from Rias Baixas which is just the perfect balance of salinity with citrus to really balance that vibrant sauce. I may have drunk my glass of this one a little too quickly...\n\n\n\nNo sooner have I swiped my last hunk of sourdough through the delightful green sauce, our plates are whisked away and replaced with another elegantly garnished dish. A gloriously fatty, blushing piece of pork, as well as a small homemade sausage is served with roasted squash, topped with their homemade pumpkin seed miso, and sea buckthorn puree. The pork is up there with some of the most delicious meat I\u2019ve ever eaten. Overall I found the dish quite sweet which was beautifully balanced out with the wine pairing. Another natural wine, this time a Pinot Noir made by a female producer in Burgundy. It was light, full of red fruit flavour and oh so easy to drink. We would have been very happy if the remainder of the bottle had found its way to our table. \n\n\n\nTwo of my favourite words on a menu are \u201ccheese supplement\u201d because it means that the restaurant\u2019s ethos is perfectly in line with my own: always add cheese. I love cheese in all its forms however I find it a little humdrum when a quality restaurant offers a cheese board. The classic combination of one soft, one hard, one blue, some crackers and maybe some chutney has its time and its place but a tasting menu isn\u2019t one of them. I find it much more interesting when the cheese course is treated as a course in its own right. I\u2019m glad to report that Inver passed muster on that score. Two hearty slices of Lanark Blue were served with some homemade damson conserve, chunky homemade oat crackers and shards of rye crispbread scattered with salt and caraway seeds. We linger over it with a glass of French fortified red, Banyuls, and I am in heaven.\n\nAlas, all good things much come to an end and our meal ended with a cake I can\u2019t stop thinking about. A little pre-dessert of greengage sorbet was one of the most delicious things I have put in my mouth this year, and then as if that wasn\u2019t wonderful enough, there was a cake. A honey cake with dulce de leche and burnt honey cream frosting, served with a raspberry granita. The balance of the intensely sweet honey cream with the sharp, bracing granita was a perfect close to our evening. And of course there was wine too. A fabulous dessert wine from the South West of France, made by a lady in her 90s no less who took over wine production after the death of her husband.    \n\n\nA good story can transport you to another world, completely engrossing you in the characters\u2019 way of life and a good meal can do that too. This tasting menu was woven with stories. Stories of the Scottish countryside and coastline, stories of the producers and suppliers, the stories of the chefs, the stories of the little antique trinkets. In this remote, almost ethereal setting, listening to the stories of the 90 year old wine producer, the fisherman who caught the mackerel that morning, the chefs who have worked for weeks to create the sunflower seed miso, it feels like we are briefly transported.",

        "text": "Food\u2019s special relationship: five chefs and their suppliers\nThis article is more than 8 years old\nFrom pig farmers in Herefordshire to scallop divers on Mull, Britain\u2019s best suppliers develop a bond with the chefs who put their food on the table\nBob Granleese\nSun 21 Feb 2016 09.00 GMT\nShare\nRichard Vaughan, Huntsham Farm, supplies Simon Rogan, L\u2019Enclume, Fera and The French\nBack in March 2009, Richard Vaughan of Huntsham Farm in Herefordshire made possibly the best decision of his professional life when he rocked up at Simon Rogan\u2019s Cumbrian enclave, L\u2019Enclume, hoping to sell some of his middle white pork to perhaps the most notoriously picky of all Britain\u2019s Michelin-starred chefs. Seven years on, not only is Vaughan still selling his pigs to Rogan\u2019s ever-expanding empire (the chef now also runs Fera in London and The French in Manchester), but the trade as a whole talks about Vaughan\u2019s middle whites in quasi-reverential tones. \u201cI haven\u2019t a clue what makes our pork different from other people\u2019s pork,\u201d he says with a contented chuckle, \u201cbut that\u2019s because I\u2019ve got no idea how anyone else farms their pigs. I only know how we look after ours.\u201d\n\n\nVaughan may claim not to know what sets his pigs apart, but Rogan certainly does: \u201cRichard\u2019s pork has incredible flavour and fat content and, as anyone who knows anything about cooking will tell you, the fat\u2019s where all the good stuff is. I was aware of the British tradition for middle whites, and the quality of the meat, but they went out of fashion last century because of the rise in demand for bacon pigs, which are by necessity much leaner.\u201d\n\nWhen you\u2019re cooking at the level Rogan is, you tend to deal only in world-class products, and he says wouldn\u2019t hesitate to put Vaughan\u2019s middle white in that category. \u201cHis are healthy, happy animals, and that really shows through in the end product. I\u2019d go so far as to say he\u2019s the blueprint for how any pig farmer should operate.\u201d\n\nVaughan cheerfully admits that he doesn\u2019t play by the pig-farming rulebook: \u201cWe slaughter our pigs at about five months, then hang them for 13 days, which is thought of as a bit wacky. \u2018You don\u2019t need to hang pork,\u2019 they all say. Well, in my book, you do, because that\u2019s how our customers like it. Any animals that are over-fat or over-lean go into sausages, which ensures we can deliver a very consistent pork pig. What\u2019s kept me and Simon together so long is that, essentially, he likes what I do. I\u2019m under no illusions that if I don\u2019t keep my standards up, he\u2019ll just look elsewhere.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t seem likely any time soon: Rogan\u2019s attention to detail in his sourcing is such that he even has his own farm within spitting distance of L\u2019Enclume, to supply the restaurant, and for a time they dabbled in rearing lop ears. \u201cThey were very high-maintenance,\u201d he says, \u201cand since the farm is run predominately by our chefs, we just can\u2019t spare the time to manage pigs, too.\u201d\n\n\nTo call Vaughan\u2019s profession high-maintenance is a bit of an understatement, especially when you consider his latest groundbreaking wheeze, which was the happy byproduct of a failed experiment for Nuno Mendes. \u201cA year or so ago, Nuno asked us to try hanging a carcass for him for 40 days \u2013 he was after something similar to the pigs they have in Portugal and Spain. I thought he was being daft, and told him so, but we gave it a go. As it turned out, it wasn\u2019t quite right for him, but it got me thinking. I had an old fridge doing nothing, so decided to trial a 55-day-aged carcass. When we tasted it, everyone went \u201cWow!\u201d \u2013 the meat was thicker, more unctuous. It\u2019s not quite a ham, but it\u2019s moving in that direction.\u201d\n\nThe new product knocked Rogan\u2019s socks off, too. \u201cI\u2019d put his dry-aged pork on a par with the best Iberico any day,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fact that it\u2019s British is just the icing on the cake.\u201d He now has it on the menu at both Fera and the French.\n\nFor a small outfit that sells just 30 pigs a week in all, it\u2019s innovations such as this that help keep Vaughan in with the serious operators such as Rogan. \u201cI don\u2019t get to speak with Simon as much as I used to,\u201d he says just a little sadly. \u201cBut that\u2019s because he\u2019s such a big wheel these days. Mind you, for us every customer is \u2013 so long as they pay their bill on time.\u201d\n\nEmily and Lucy McVeigh, Kenton Hall Estate, supply Richard Turner, Turner & George\nChef Richard Turner photographed with Emily McVeigh and Lucy McVeigh at Kenton Hall Estate in Suffolk, England.\nView image in fullscreen\n Photograph: Richard Saker for Observer Food Monthly\nThe McVeigh sisters aren\u2019t exactly your average cattle farmers. For one thing, they\u2019re in their early 20s (Lucy\u2019s 21 and Emily 25); for another, they\u2019re \u2013 shock, horror \u2013 women. By contrast, Richard Turner has the look of a man born to work in the meat trade: burly, bearded and maybe not quite as buff as he used to be. Talk about chalk and cheese \u2013 but, as it turns out, they\u2019re kindred spirits.\n\n\u201cI only met them last autumn,\u201d Turner says, \u201cwhen I was judging the meat category at the Young British Foodies awards 2015. They came second, but their longhorn beef stuck in my mind. They\u2019re only young kids, but they\u2019re passionate about what they do, and their product is excellent.\u201d\n\n\nEmily remembers the meeting rather differently. \u201cIt was terrifying,\u201d she says. \u201cThe other judges were James George [Turner\u2019s business partner in rare-breed butcher\u2019s Turner & George] and Neil Rankin, there were six finalists, and we had to cook them a steak. We were the only girls, too; meat farming is still very male-dominated.\u201d\n\nShe can say that again, but for your product to catch Turner\u2019s eye is a rare achievement no matter your age or gender. \u201cTheir longhorn is bloody gorgeous,\u201d says Britain\u2019s Mr Meat, \u201cbut the other thing about them is that they clearly love cattle farming, from ageing and husbandry to new techniques, the whole shebang.\u201d\n\nLucy runs the farming side, while Emily is the marketeer; it helps that their father is behind the scenes, too. \u201cDad\u2019s still involved, but he more or less handed over the day-to-day business to us about two years ago,\u201d Emily explains. \u201cHe\u2019s in his 50s now and wanted to take a bit of a back seat. It was Dad who started our longhorn herd with seven cattle back in 2007; now we\u2019ve got 50. We started selling it commercially only two years ago \u2013 before that, it was just for friends and family.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still a relatively small-scale operation, but Turner has plans for Kenton Hall\u2019s beef. \u201cAt the moment it\u2019s a question of supply \u2013 there\u2019s no way I could take their stuff for Hawksmoor, for instance, because they simply don\u2019t have that kind of capacity.\u201d\n\nThat said, he\u2019s now counting the days until the herd is big enough for Turner & George\u2019s purposes, and he\u2019s already got the McVeighs lined up to supply \u201ca couple of things I\u2019m working on right now\u201d. Turner is one of those restaurateurs who has always got a project or five on the go: as well as the Hawksmoor empire, he\u2019s also involved with Pitt Cue and various street food events, and is currently helping set up Bastien, a duck-themed joint scheduled to open in London later this year.\n\nTurner sees the sisters as the vanguard of the new wave of farmers who care deeply about working ethically and sustainably. \u201cLots of farmers pretend to be like that,\u201d he says with a snort of derision, \u201cbut they\u2019re just jumping on the bandwagon because it makes them look cool.\u201d\n\nThe McVeighs, however, both talk the talk and walk the walk. \u201cEthical farming and delicious meat go hand in hand,\u201d Emily insists. \u201cMost beef cattle are slaughtered at 18 months \u2013 we keep ours to 30 months, then hang them for another month after that. It\u2019s an old-fashioned approach, sure, but the older the animal, the better the taste. Richard feels exactly the same way.\u201d\n\nTurner has also helped broaden Kenton Hall\u2019s horizons, Emily says. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a pop-up at the Vault Festival in London at the moment \u2013 just our burgers, hotpot, that kind of thing. Richard helped us feel our way into the London market, which is a massive deal for us.\u201d\n\nThe sisters have time on their side, and not just because they\u2019re still so ridiculously young. \u201cIt\u2019s very early days,\u201d Emily says, \u201cbut we\u2019re in no mega-rush.\u201d And anyway, it\u2019s not as if they\u2019re going anywhere else: \u201cOur family\u2019s been farming since the 1640s, so it\u2019s in our bones.\u201d\n\nGuy Grieve, the Ethical Shellfish Company, supplies Tim Hughes, J Sheekey\nGuy Grieve, the Ethical Shellfish Company, supplies Tim Hughes, J Sheekey\nView image in fullscreen\n Photograph: Martin Hunter for Observer Food Monthly\n\nSix years ago, Guy Grieve seemed to be heading down a very different career path. He had lived solo for a year in the wilds of Alaska, taken his young sons out of school to sail from Venezuela to Scotland and had two TV series under his belt (2007\u2019s The Wild Gourmets and A Cook\u2019s Tour Of Spain three years later); not to put too fine a point on it, he seemed well on his way to becoming a kind of prototype Bear Grylls. But in 2010 he dropped everything, upped sticks with his family to the Isle of Mull \u2013 \u201cthe edge of the world, more or less,\u201d he says with a grin \u2013 and set out on a new adventure as a scallop diver.\n\nIt would be a whole year later that Grieve\u2019s new business, the Ethical Shellfish Company, got its big break when Tim Hughes started buying his scallops for J Sheekey. \u201cIt was our first real sense of hope,\u201d Grieve says. \u201cIf someone of Tim\u2019s calibre thinks you can come up with the goods, everyone else takes note.\u201d Having Hughes on board didn\u2019t just mean Sheekey\u2019s, either: he\u2019s chef director across Caprice Holdings, so also holds the purse strings at Scott\u2019s and The Ivy, among a host of others. It helps, also, that Hughes is a proper, old-fashioned no-nonsense chef, the kind who just gets on with the job, rather than pining to show off on the telly.\n\n\u201cWe used to get our scallops from all over the place,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cWherever our buyers could find them, basically \u2013 some were hand-dived, but a fair few were dredged. Then Roy Brett at Ondine in Edinburgh called up out of the blue to tell me about this fantastic new operation on Mull. When I tried Guy\u2019s scallops for the first time, I was totally blown away. They had it all: fantastic quality plus provable sustainability is about as good as it gets in this game. So I immediately told Guy that if he could get the delivery systems right, I was totally up for doing business.\u201d\n\nHughes\u2019s decision had a profound impact. \u201cAt the time, I did all the fishing myself,\u201d Grieve says. \u201cAnd all the deliveries, too \u2013 you could say I have a sadomasochistic inclination.\u201d It helps that he\u2019s a walking, talking Duracell bunny of a human being, with apparently boundless energy and enthusiasm. \u201cI was fishing out of a six-metre inflatable rib because it was all we could afford, and afterwards I\u2019d rush off to catch the 7pm ferry from Mull, drive straight to Birmingham to make the first deliveries at 4am, then carry on down to Tim in London. It was knackering, but without Tim taking a punt on us, I doubt we\u2019d be where we are now.\u201d\n\nThese days, Grieve operates out of a 10-tonne larchwood boat, complete with galley and berth, unheard of luxuries five years ago \u2013 \u201cI can actually have a proper sleep,\u201d he says, clearly still bowled over by the very thought \u2013 and employs 12 divers, as well as four full-time and two part-time staff. \u201cThat\u2019s a big deal for somewhere like Mull: it brings about \u00a330,000 into the island economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI basically take whatever Guy can get us now,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cWe\u2019re at something like 1,000 a week across the whole group. The thing about Guy\u2019s scallops is, they last, which is an invaluable commodity. They\u2019re caught the day before they come to us, and we can have them on the table by lunchtime. To be able to work with something this fresh is a real privilege for a chef. Plus they\u2019re delivered alive, so they don\u2019t go off; there\u2019s very little wasteage.\u201d\n\n\nThe dreaded \u201cw\u201d word gets Grieve\u2019s goat, too. \u201cWe fish all our scallops in areas that haven\u2019t been dredged for the simple reason that, if it\u2019s been bottom-trawled, there\u2019s nothing there,\u201d he says matter-of-factly. \u201cChefs are a bit like heads of state in that respect, because their buying decisions have an immediate impact on the environment.\n\n\u201cTim was the first cook I came across who realises there\u2019s no such thing as cheap seafood,\u201d says Grieve. \u201cThe cost to the environment has to be factored in, too.\u201d\n\nHughes couldn\u2019t agree more: \u201cThe sooner people realise what really goes into catching the fish we put on our plates, the better off we\u2019ll all be.\u201d\n\nJane Scotter and Harry Astley, Fern Verrow, supply Skye Gyngell, Spring\nJane Scotter and Harry Astley, Fern Verrow, supply Skye Gyngell, Spring\nView image in fullscreen\n Photograph: Harry Borden for Observer Food Monthly\nWhen Skye Gyngell swapped Petersham Nurseries Cafe in leafy west London for the altogether swankier affair that is Spring in Somerset House, the move was more than one of location and scale. \u201cThe vegetable garden at Petersham was a constant inspiration,\u201d the chef says, \u201cbut in the West End that source of creativity just isn\u2019t possible. That\u2019s where Fern Verrow came in \u2013 I knew a bit about them, and in early 2014 I cold-called Jane, to ask if they\u2019d be interested in supplying us. Frankly, I was expecting a no.\u201d\n\nGyngell\u2019s timing couldn\u2019t have been better. \u201cWe were in the middle of writing a book and already thinking about how to get out of doing the market in London every week,\u201d Jane Scotter says. At the time, her and Harry Astley\u2019s main source of income was their stall at Spa Terminus, where they sold the biodynamic fruits and veg of their labours in the Black Mountains.\n\nFor the next six months, while Gyngell was finessing her menus before Spring\u2019s grand opening in autumn 2014, they\u2019d drop off the pick of their wares on their way to market each week: \u201cIt was a trial run,\u201d Astley says. \u201cAnd now, instead of coming up to market, we make two deliveries a week to Spring.\u201d\n\n\nBut this is no normal chef-supplier relationship. \u201cWe\u2019re involved every step of the way,\u201d Gyngell says. \u201cWe do the planting and growing hand in hand, and we stipulate what we\u2019d like them to grow for us. About 95% of all our fruit and veg comes from Jane and Harry.\u201d It\u2019s a different way of doing things, Scotter says: \u201cShe\u2019s the artist and we provide the natural \u2018paints\u2019. It\u2019s not the normal chef\u2019s 12.30am phone call to their wholesaler. This is a marriage, of sorts.\u201d\n\nLike any marriage, it relies on hard work to keep things on an even keel, though this one involves an awful lot of spreadsheets. \u201cWe have to sow six months in advance,\u201d Astley explains, \u201cso there\u2019s loads of planning.\u201d Gyngell has to let Fern Verrow know roughly how much of any one product she thinks she\u2019s going to need way down the line, though in some cases they can make an educated guess. \u201cAs much raw food as possible for salads,\u201d Scotter laughs. \u201cAnd Skye gets through ridiculous amounts of spinach.\u201d\n\nThe partnership was a leap of faith for both parties, \u201cbut the trust issue was biggest for them,\u201d Gyngell insists, \u201cbecause I can always pick up the phone and order from someone else. I feel a huge sense of responsibility for them. I see Spring as a patron of the farm, rather than a customer.\u201d\n\nThe attention to detail is such that Fern Verrow even package the produce to suit Spring\u2019s walk-in fridges. \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly selective on Skye\u2019s behalf,\u201d Astley says. \u201cEverything is still in the ground when her order comes in.\u201d\n\nOf course, there\u2019s not so much for Gyngell to choose from at this time of year. \u201cWe\u2019ve only got about 15 things on the go right now,\u201d Scotter says, \u201cbut that\u2019ll rise to 30 or 40 in April/May and around 80 by August, at the peak of the growing season.\u201d\n\nPerversely, that bounty turns up at exactly the wrong time for a restaurant in the West End. \u201cI hadn\u2019t a clue how dead summer was in central London,\u201d Gyngell says. \u201cWe never experienced that lull at Petersham. For instance, we\u2019d planned on getting 30 kilos of strawberries a week from Jane and Harry, and ended up with more like 70 \u2013 there\u2019s only so much you can do with a strawberry, you know.\u201d\n\nThe summer downturn was a shock for Scotter and Astley, too. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t crossed any of our minds,\u201d Scotter admits, \u201cbut we\u2019ll be ready this summer: we\u2019ve already made plans for Spring\u2019s staff to come to help out on the farm, and the chefs will use the down time to make jams, pickles and cordials for the restaurant.\u201d It\u2019s a farm-to-fork relationship that\u2019s all too rare in the UK, and more in keeping with the American model trailblazed by the likes of Chez Panisse. \u201cSomehow, the one just makes the other better,\u201d Gyngell says. \u201cFern Verrow\u2019s produce defines Spring as a restaurant.\u201d\n\nIan Perkes and Nigel Ward, Brixham Seafish, supply Mitch Tonks, The Seahorse and Rockfish\nIan Perkes and Nigel Ward, Brixham Seafish, supply Mitch Tonks, The Seahorse and Rockfish\nView image in fullscreen\n Photograph: Harry Borden for Observer Food Monthly\n\nCooks and their suppliers often operate under an uneasy truce: on the chef\u2019s part, they\u2019re forever griping about the product not meeting the standards they require, while the supplier faces a constant struggle to get the chef to pay up on time. But not when it comes to Mitch Tonks and his fish guys, Ian Perkes and Nigel Ward of Brixham Seafish. \u201cI\u2019ve known them since I opened my first ever place, Green Street Seafood Cafe in Bath, in 1995,\u201d says the accountant turned seafood guru. \u201cThey were running an outfit called Channel Fisheries, and got in touch wanting to send me a sample box of their fish. It was bloody good gear, too. One thing led to another, and we\u2019ve now been working together for more than 20 years. They\u2019re less suppliers than mates, and you can\u2019t beat that \u2013 it means we can iron out any differences over a brandy or two.\u201d\n\nThe phrase \u201cI\u2019ve been Tonksed\u201d is code in certain circles of the restaurant world for the most horrific hangover imaginable, and Ward and Perkes have been victims more than most over the years, but that doesn\u2019t seem to have put them off. \u201cWhen I first met Mitch, he didn\u2019t know all that much about fish, to be perfectly honest,\u201d Ward says with a laugh, \u201cbut the thing that really struck you was his sheer enthusiasm. He hasn\u2019t changed much on that score, but he now \u2018gets\u2019 fish the way we do.\u201d\n\nPerkes sees the secret of the relationship in more personal terms: \u201cI\u2019ve been in this game too long to bother with chefs who think they\u2019re something special, or that it\u2019s OK to scream and shout at you about not getting them this and that,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re nice people, and we want to work with nice people.\u201d\n\nNot that it\u2019s all plain sailing, Perkes admits: \u201cWe\u2019re at Tonksy\u2019s beck and call for what feels like 396 days a year, which is exhausting \u2013 he\u2019s knackering to be around at the best of times. Don\u2019t tell him this, but I actually wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d\n\nWard concurs: \u201cWe\u2019re a small bespoke outfit, with only 40-50 customers, so we try to deal with people we like \u2013 that\u2019s our bottom line.\u201d\n\nTonks allows his fish buyers unusual freedom. \u201cThey do everything for us,\u201d the chef says, \u201cand we rarely put in a specific order. Fishing\u2019s such an up-and-down business, you can never be certain what\u2019s going to be available on any given day. Most of the time, Nige will just pick up what\u2019s good at the market and we\u2019ll work with whatever he sends us. That just adds to the fun and excitement of cooking, though, because we often don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to come through the door. It\u2019s a unique supply chain, really.\u201d\n\nWard doesn\u2019t have things completely his own way, though: \u201cWhen the weather\u2019s bad, there can be next to nothing at the market,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I still have to find stuff Mitch can work with: he\u2019s got four Rockfishes now, plus the Seahorse, and they can\u2019t just not open because I haven\u2019t got them the raw materials.\u201d Ignore the trademark full-length black leather coat, and Ward has about him more than a touch of the Terry-Thomases, but the louche exterior hides a consummate fish operator: \u201cNigel\u2019s my eyes in the market,\u201d Tonks says, \u201cand I trust him 100%.\u201d\n\nPerkes, meanwhile, is the guy who makes the contacts and smooths the wheels. \u201cTop-quality fish costs,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd so it should when you consider what goes into getting hold of it. I started out in this business in 1976, and should have had my gold watch for long service by now. Come to think of it, maybe I\u2019ll ask Mitch to buy me one.\u201d",

        "text": "Cafe At Daylesford Organic\nSince Daylesford Organic first began work on their Cotswolds farm, they have made a concerted effort to bring the sustainability of countryside living to the city. Forty years later, their four caf\u00e9s and farmshops offer a celebration of both ethical farming and British culture. Located in some of the most iconic areas of London, their recently renovated Pimlico branch is a five minute walk from the Chelsea Barracks estate.\n\nWe recently discussed Daylesford Organic with their Head of Sustainability, Will Dennis, \u201cWe have been pioneers of regenerative farming for almost fifty years, using nature-led techniques to nurture the soil and protect the environment without the use of chemicals.\u201d\n\n Daylesford Produce\nThe menus of the caf\u00e9 follow the rhythm of the seasons. Autumn, for example, saw their chefs showcase a selection of fresh and flavourful ingredients direct from the Daylesford Farm, while their Spring menu features spiced Kerry Hill lamb burgers, spring greens minestrone. The spring salad with pea and quinoa fritters and salsa verde yoghurt is a delicious lighter option, leaving space for the poached rhubarb and ginger cheesecake for dessert. Ingredients are primarily sourced directly from the farm in Gloucestershire.\n\nFor produce not available at the farm, Daylesford look to suppliers who share their principles of sustainability and ethical farming. There is a commitment throughout each Daylesford location to champion British food that celebrates local farmers.\n\n Daylesford Cafe\nFor lovers of fine wine, the Daylesford sister estate Ch\u00e2teau L\u00e9oube in southern France has produced bottles that have won a litany of awards in the past year alone, including Gold at the London Wine Competition for Love by L\u00e9oube Ros\u00e9, while Secret de L\u00e9oube Ros\u00e9 scored 91/100 from the 2022 Robert Parker Wine Awards.\n\nWhile the food at Daylesford Organic has earned them their recognition, their range of botanical candles have quickly become sought-after items from their farmshops. Geranium is their most popular of their signature fragrances, available as a candle, reed diffuser and also hand wash.\n\n Daylesford Hampers\nOf the recent renovations at their Pimlico branch, Dennis said that in addition to improving their energy efficiency and carbon intensity, Daylesford were looking to refresh the look and feel for their customers after first opening over 15 years ago.\n\n\u201cWherever possible, we have tried to retain and restore the original features, so visually it may seem that there is little change, however major works were undertaken to upgrade the heating, refrigeration and lighting systems\u201d The changes made have all contributed to their energy rating improving from a C to a B. Dennis stated that the upgrades will lead to a 9% annual energy reduction as well as 10% lower carbon emissions.\n\nDaylesford Organic pride themselves on serving food and drink that is not just full of flavour but is organic and ethically sourced. When asked what the mark is for a great meal, Dennis remarked that although it starts with great food, the company and atmosphere are a must. What Daylesford offers patrons is the highest quality of organic food and wine but the perfect setting as well. Although Pimlico Road is the closest to Chelsea Barracks, each of the four London branches offer the same sense of community and character that reflects the warmth of their flagship farm in the Cotswolds.\n\nThe invitation from Dennis and the staff at Daylesford Organic is proffered: bring your favourite people and they will do the rest.",

This ethos has flowed into building relationships with organic British suppliers and sourcing responsibly from small like-minded producers, including our own farm \u2013 Haye Farm Devon. Bringing the very best organic and sustainably produced meat and vegetables straight from the farm to our kitchens.\nSeasonality\nWith our menus being refreshed through the season, our chefs only use produce which is at its peak. Most ingredients are British first, while some speciality ingredients are sourced from Italy \u2013 such as Parmesan, White Truffles, Olive Oil and Vanilla pods. As we are so seasonally led, the colours of the plate naturally reflect the changing view outside.",

        "text": "Sustainability Update\n \nHi everyone, Eloise here!\nUsually you can find me serving food and drinks in our busy restaurant, but since the summer I\u2019ve also been working to implement sustainable practices across the business.\nAs a regenerative, biodynamic vineyard and farm, respecting the environment is hugely important to all of us at Tillingham and as a result I\u2019ve been working to ensure that this respect is continued throughout the restaurant and kitchen. Reducing our impact on the planet has never been more important, so I have been looking for ways that we can do this across the business, some of which I wanted to detail in this journal\u2026\nCOMPOST:\nIn addition to composting our winery waste (grapes etc), we are now composting all of our fruit and veg scraps from the kitchen along with the tea and coffee grounds from the bar. These will go onto the heap in our walled garden to be used to enrich the soil for next year\u2019s harvest!\nREFILLING:\nWe pledged to reduce our single-use plastic use by 2022, so with the help of our wonderful suppliers, most of our deliveries are now coming in reusable crates and containers. Coldblow Coffee are sending us coffee beans in refillable tubs, and Hook & Son now deliver our milk in refillable glass bottles.\nREUSING:\nWhilst some packaging is unavoidable, we have been finding creative ways to reuse them. Plastic olive tubs have now become storage in the kitchen, whilst our empty wine bottles are being repurposed for candles and flowers. In the restaurant, bar and kitchen, we are recycling anything we can\u2019t compost or reuse, aiming to send minimal waste to landfill.",

        "text": "At first glance, Tarporley could be one of many quintessentially rural English villages or small towns. But delve a little deeper and you'll find a range of shops that's hard to match.\n\nIt's the nature of these businesses that make Tarporley so special, the High Street and Park Road, are home to unique, independently owned stores.\n\nTraders say this independent spirit is vital to Tarporley's success.\n\n'Tarporley is a busy village with many owner-run shops. There's a vibrancy and so much choice,' says Mary Brogelli, of Baile Home. 'It's a great place to do business. There's a spirit of co-operation, with everyone working well together, and we're supported by a loyal customer base.'\n\nRascal and Radical: Zara Rafferty, Martine van de Steene, Jan Deering and Verity Burton. (Image: Nigel Howle)\n\nThis positive spirit was in evidence when I visited the Rascal and Radical bar on a weekday morning. The High Street venue was packed with small-business owners and entrepreneurs, attending a networking event organised by marketing agency owner Alex Morrisroe.\n\nJan Cameron, chair of the Tarporley Business Club, told me: 'We have a special energy here because local businesses love to get together and support each other.'\n\nHow to subscribe to Cheshire Life\n\nEstate agent Oliver Ball, another attendee at the Grub and Grow networking event, described Tarporley is a sought-after area in which to live, with a buoyant housing market.\n\n'There are several different reasons why Tarporley is attractive to home buyers,' added Oliver, of Lawrenson Ball. 'It has a vibrant centre, excellent quality schools, there's a great number of high-quality homes, and we're seeing a trend, particularly post-Covid, of people moving out of cities and into rural towns and villages.'\n\nThe Follies of Tarporley family-owned boutique. (Image: Nigel Howle)\n\nThe diverse High Street makes Tarporley an unexpected destination for discerning shoppers from Cheshire and North Wales.\n\nIt's renowned as a must-visit place for high-end fashion buyers and is home to several interior design specialists.\n\nPopular independent shops include women's designer fashion boutique Si Belle; Follies of Tarporley, a lady's outfitters with a wide choice of designer wear; Hoity Toity Shoes; Ginger and Pickles Bakehouse; the Little Potting Shed and florist Bramble and Blooms.\n\nBaile has just moved to a bigger home. (Image: Nigel Howle)\n\nBaile recently moved from the High Street to Park Road in search of a larger more suitable space. Mary Brogelli describes her stock as everything handmade or rugged, from small furnishings to Donegal sweaters - a reflection of the owner's Irish roots.\n\n'There are lots of shops I would recommend and many are family-owned. Our neighbour, Follies, was set up by the mother of the current owner.'\n\nZara Rafferty, of Zara Elizabeth Interiors, said: 'Tarporley is a beautiful part of Cheshire and the High Street has an excellent community of shops, bars, and places to eat. I founded the business in 2016 and have created a wonderful portfolio of clients. I have completed many prestigious properties across Cheshire and beyond, working with suppliers from fabrics to furniture, and the best architects, lighting designers, curtain makers and carpenters, and they are all based in Cheshire.'\n\nTarporley also ticks the boxes for visitors looking for places to eat and drink. Coffee shops and tea rooms include Latte Da, on the High Street, which is popular for morning coffee or afternoon tea and has an attractive outdoor seating area. Nearby you will find Fuel, part of the Instinct fitness and wellbeing suite, with a coffee shop that also specialises in health food and drink.\n\nThe delightful Lockgate Coffee House, on the outskirts of town, is popular with walkers and cyclists, and as a dog-friendly venue, even offering a canine menu.\n\nThere's an excellent choice of restaurants and bars serving Tarporley. The Swan, at the heart of the High Street, describes itself as a classic British inn. Owned and run by local company, Bear Inns, it has been welcoming visitors for more than 400 years.\n\nThe Swan has been welcoming guests to Tarporley for more than 400 years. (Image: Cheshire Pub Company)\n\nIt serves as a focal point for many Tarporley events, including a comedy club. Woody Barlow, founder and director of Bear Inns, says: 'The Swan has four centuries of history and is at the very heart of the community, open all day, every day. It's a place where visitors can enjoy a warming cappuccino, breakfast, lunch, or dinner from a great selection of locally sourced produce.'\n\nNearby, you'll find the Little Tap, renowned for its inventive small plates menu, craft beer and spirits. The Coast restaurant and bar has an Italian-influenced menu, while the Foresters Arms is a more traditional pub, with a restaurant and accommodation.\n\nThe Rascal and Radical is a recent addition to the High Street. Historically the building was Tarporley's old fire station, and most recently a chocolate shop. It was bought by the Cheshire Pub Company. and has benefitted from an extensive refit.\n\nOwner Simon Kalton says: 'We had been looking for a location in Tarporley for some time because it is a place with an active village centre and friendly shops.\n\n'The company has spent around half a million pounds on the kitchen, bar and fittings, and it's going well, with excellent support from visitors from Tarporley and further afield.'\n\nTarporley Business Group: David Cramp, Jan Cameron and Oliver Ball (Image: Nigel Howle)\n\nThe parish church, St Helen's, is located centrally on the High Street and parts of the building date back to the 15th century.\n\nTarporley is also a popular destination for golfers - the Portal Golf and Spa Resort has a four-star hotel, three golf courses - including one of championship standard course offering a good challenge to even the best players - and spa and swimming facilities in which to ease the aches and pains following a day on the fairways or walking in the Cheshire countryside.\n\nBeeston Castle sits atop a rocky crag high above the Cheshire Plain. (Image: Getty)\n\nWhat to see\n\nTarporley is located less than 11 miles away from the walled city of Chester, with its extensive shopping, history and tourism offer. But the village has its own visitor attraction - Beeston Castle - within its boundaries.\n\nSitting atop a rocky crag high above the Cheshire Plain, Beeston is one of the most dramatically sited medieval castles in England. On a clear day, you can see all the way from the Pennines to the Welsh mountains.\n\nThe grounds of Beeston Castle feature a replica Bronze Age roundhouse and a 40-acre woodland park.\n\nFrom the top of the castle walls, visitors can peer down into the castle well, said to be the hiding place of Richard II's lost treasure.\n\nBeeston Castle was built by the Sixth Earl of Chester in the 1220s and incorporates the banks and ditches of an iron hill fort. Henry the Third seized the castle in 1237 and it remained in royal ownership until the 16th century.\n\nDuring the English Civil War, Beeston was seized by Cromwell's forces and partially demolished in 1646.\n\nPeckforton Castle is just a short distance away, but is very different from its neighbour, both in its history, and modern use, as it now houses a luxury hotel.\n\nThe castle was built between 1840 and 1851, in a medieval style, as a home for the Tollemache family. The modern-day hotel has 48 individually designed guest rooms and the venue has also proved popular as a film and TV location.\n\nThe Ice Cream Farm in nearby Tattenhall is a popular family visitor attraction, while Bunbury Mill is home to a working 100-year-old water-powered mill and has a visitor centre and tea room.\n\nPeckforton Castle, one of two Cheshire landmarks close to Tarporley. (Image: Peckforton Castle)\n\nTwo castles on one walk\n\nA circular trail, exploring the Beeston and Peckforton Hills, affording spectacular views of Beeston and Peckforton castles, is popular with walkers.\n\nIt's a relatively short circuit, at less than four miles and is graded as an easy to mid-difficulty walk, but it can become very muddy during prolonged wet weather.\n\nStarting from Beeston Castle car park (pay and display), opposite Beeston Castle gateway, Chapel Lane, Beeston, walk left along the road for just a few yards then bear right along a fenced footpath beside the entrance to the Sandstone Caf\u00c3\u00a9.\n\nThe easy-to-follow path goes down to a lane opposite a house called Tabernacle Cottage. Turn left up the lane and then, a few yards later, right up steps and onto the Sandstone Trail, crossing a field. Here you'll gain a view of Peckforton Castle, poking through woodland.\n\nProceed down some steps, over a footbridge and on to a junction of paths. Walk straight on, following the Sandstone Trail along a right-hand field edge. Go through a kissing gate and across the next field to the next kissing gate, and on to Horsley Lane. A right turn takes you to Ivy Cottage, at which point you should go left through a metal gate following the Sandstone Trail into the Peckforton Estate.\n\nYou will reach a way marker indicating that the sandstone trail turns left but go straight on and walk downhill to a metal gate where you'll join Pennsylvania Lane. From here, walk towards the Pheasant Inn.\n\nFollow the lane to a T-junction, bear left uphill, then go left again into Rock Lane. When the road forks, Rock Lane goes to the left, but you need to stay right as the road becomes Hill Lane. You will pass a way marker for the Sandstone Trail but keep going straight ahead, and through a gate where the lane turns into a wide unmade track through a lightly wooded area.\n\nOnce you reach a large stone arch, the lane becomes asphalted. Continue until you reach the gatehouse for Peckforton Castle and Peckforton Road.\n\nWalk on to a private lane on the Peckforton estate and look for the gate on the right signposted for Beeston Castle.",

This sophisticated venue, adorned with botanical accents, is set to be SSP\u2019s inaugural airside outlet within this terminal.\n\nChristened through a competition involving Manchester Airport staff, the establishment promises a high-end pre-flight experience for departing travelers. Its menu showcases artisanal delights sourced from various Northern suppliers.\n\nNestled in the main atrium of the departure lounge, The Evergreen Bar & Brasserie offers a welcoming and airy ambiance for passengers embarking on their journeys. Whether patrons seek a hearty breakfast paired with freshly brewed coffee or opt for a sharing board and a glass of wine at the prominent bar, there\u2019s a diverse selection to delight palates throughout the day.\n\nThe debut of this 144-seat restaurant aligns with the airport\u2019s ongoing \u00a31.3bn transformation initiative, slated to significantly expand Terminal 2\u2019s capacity upon its anticipated completion next year.\n\nKari Daniels, CEO of SSP UK & Ireland said: \u201cWe have partnered with MAG for many years, bringing some of the country\u2019s best-loved brands to customers. We\u2019re delighted to have opened our first bespoke airside bar in this terminal, which will bring a premium dining experience to those wanting a final taste of Manchester before departure. Offering bespoke outlets is an important part of our strategy, ensuring we surprise and delight our customers while also providing a new experience each time they travel.\u201d\n\nStephen Turner, Commercial Director at Manchester Airport, said: \u201cWe want passengers to start their holidays when they arrive at the airport so we\u2019re always looking to make sure we offer experiences to match every taste. That\u2019s why we\u2019re delighted to open The Evergreen Bar & Brasserie. The design of the restaurant is fresh and modern, but also relaxed and comfortable, providing customers with a memorable and distinctively Northern experience thanks to the focus on regional produce.\n\n\u201cTerminal 2 is the centrepiece of our transformation programme and will be used by over 70 per cent of our passengers when it is complete, so we wanted to ensure we have a broad range of options for them to grab a bite to eat before they fly. This new restaurant offers something different to the existing offering in Terminal 2 while also supporting suppliers from across the North, and we are sure it will be a hit with our passengers.\u201d",

        "text": "On Wednesday in a back room at Gino's, leaders of Baton Rouge's culinary scene gathered to honor Luci and Wayne Stabiler with the announcement of the Baton Rouge Epicurean Society's 17th annual Grace \"Mama\" Marino Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nThe Stabilers made news in August 2023 when they made the incredible decision to gift full ownership of five of their restaurants -- including Sammy's Bar and Grill, Stab's Prime Steak and Seafood, Stab's Steak and Seafood in Central and The Little Village on both Airline Highway and downtown -- to the restaurants' managerial staff.\n\n\"It is unprecedented,\" said Stephen Hightower, past president/executive committee of the Epicurean Society. \"Wayne has been there, not just for me personally when I was going through a difficult time, but for this entire community -- on so many levels.\"\n\nBut Hightower, the rest of the Epicurean Society and Wayne Stabiler himself agree that Luci Stabiler plays an enormous role in the success of the Stabiler businesses and restaurants.\n\n\"Luci and Wayne are so deserving of this award. I learned where there is a good man -- there's a good woman,\" said Gino Marino, son of Grace \"Mama\" Marino for whom the award is named. \"Luci is a big part of all of this and their success.\"\n\nWayne Stabiler is known for keeping a low profile and rarely drawing attention to himself even though he's been a part of the local food scene since the 1980s while still in high school. Back then, he made regular trips to the Louisiana coast to buy seafood from the local fishermen and would then drive the fresh catch back to Baton Rouge to sell in local markets. He opened a seafood wholesale business when he was 21.\n\nGino Marino remembers him from those days.\n\n\"Long ago, he had a place called Stabiler's Tavern. He was back there cooking by himself. He had the best roast beef po-boy in Baton Rouge -- it could compete with the ones in New Orleans,\" Marino said.\n\nWayne Stabiler often ducks attention, but he said when the Epicurean Society approached him about the honor, \"it hits different.\"\n\nHe was quick to pass the credit to his wife, Luci Stabiler.\n\n\"She has made the difference,\" he said.\n\nThe Stabilers formed the Stabiler Foundation with multiple missions, including:\n\nFunding military families through the Navy Seal Foundation.Improving lives of children in the Baton Rouge area by alleviating hunger and food insecurity.Supporting other charities that help local children.\n\nLuci and Wayne Stabiler were high school sweethearts at Broadmoor High School.\n\n\"Go Bucks,\" Luci Stabiler said at the mention of her alma mater. \"Wayne promised me he would make a difference in this world. He had a lot of knockdowns, but I'm proud of his persistence. He's the dreamer and the big vision person. He's not worried about the details. I'm the detail person. We make a great team.\"\n\nThrough the years, Wayne Stabiler's love for fresh Louisiana seafood and general appreciation for good food led him into the catering business, restaurant ownership and other food centric industries.\n\nThe couple has now been married for almost 41 years.\n\n\"He is not in this for the accolades,\" Luci Stabiler said of her husband. \"He flies way below the radar. He's the most generous person I know. One day last fall, we were sitting at the bar together at Stab's and he said, 'You're going to think I'm crazy, but I want to give these restaurants to my employees.' I said, 'I don't think that's crazy at all.'\"\n\nAnd that simple exchange, Luci Stabiler explains, started the unprecedented, generous transaction of transferring full ownership of five restaurants to the folks who had managed them for years.\n\nBack in August 2023, Joey Faciane, manager of Sammy's Bar and Grill, was one of the recipients of the Stabiler's generosity and spoke of how the enormous gift was an indication of how much the Stabilers have cared about all of their employees through the years.\n\n\"His generosity is the core of his person,\" Luci Stabiler said of her husband. \"He would give to people when we didn't have anything to give. He taught me what real generosity is -- with that, of course, what you give comes back tenfold.\"\n\nThe Baton Rouge Epicurean Society will honor the Stabilers at 6 p.m. June 13. The Grace \"Mama\" Marino Lifetime Achievement Award presentation takes place annually during a five-course dinner at L'auberge Casino Event Center. Each course is paired with specially selected fine wine.\n\nThe award recognizes a person or family from the Baton Rouge area who has dedicated their life and work to service, expanding the culinary landscape and philanthropy in the region and throughout Louisiana. It is named in honor of its first recipient.\n\nTickets for the event are $200 each. Tables of 10 are $2,000 and can be purchased by contacting Meghann Young at executivedirector.bresbrla@outlook.com for more information.\n\nAll proceeds fund local charities and programs focusing on childhood health, nutrition and education.\n\nIn 2024, the Epicurean Society will also host:\n\nSpring F\u00c3\u00aate from 2 to 5 p.m. May 19 at Houma's House, F\u00c3\u00aate Rouge from 7 to 10 p.m, Aug. 23 at L'Auberge CasinoF\u00c3\u00aate du Vin scheduled for November, with details to follow.\n\nThe Baton Rouge Epicurean Society's mission is to enrich the culinary culture for the Capital Area Community while raising funds for childhood nutrition and health initiatives, educational programs, and scholarships. It is a 501(c)3 and membership includes culinary professionals in the capital area including chefs, restaurateurs, caterers, food suppliers and wine and spirit purveyors.",

        "text": "Hann Casino Resort has not only made its mark as the first fully integrated resort in Clark, becoming an iconic landmark with its showstopping facade. The sprawling splendor is also home to equally show-stopping interiors, gaming facilities, and international hotels with world-class hospitality.\n\nThe blinking lights of almost a thousand slot machines make Hann Casino Resort look enticingly like it's the holidays all day, every day. The 130,000-square-meter gaming area also has over a hundred tables and two VIP clubs. Between Clark Marriott, the first five-star hotel in Central Luzon, and the first Swiss\u00c3\u00b4tel Clark in the Philippines, the complex offers 700 rooms with cutting-edge facilities and exceptional services. Soon to open are the salon and 8th Avenue, a strip of mid-high-end and well-loved brands to quench guests' thirst for shopping sprees during their stay.\n\nOf course, a gastronomic adventure also awaits, especially when visiting Pampanga, the culinary capital of the Philippines. This distinction is made even more significant by Hann Resorts, which has clinched the moniker \"Culinary Capital of Clark.\" Its exceptional restaurants have practically swept the Top 10 spots on the US travel research and review community Tripadvisor's list of the best dining spots in the area.\n\nExceptional Chinese cuisine at Wu Xing\n\nWu Xing, their Chinese restaurant suitable for all types of gatherings (intimate, family, or even business), was a fitting introduction.\n\nOne can't go wrong with Chinese food. It's especially true for the Filipino palate, but the statement really holds water even with international clients. Chinese dishes have reached so far and lasted so long for no reason, and Wu Xing just adds another point to that.\n\nA staple favorite from the lunch spread is the sweet and sour pork, whose coating managed to remain crunchy despite the ample sauce, and the roast beef so tender that each mouthful gets effortlessly crushed between the tongue and the roof of the mouth.\n\nTruly a must-try is their signature Peking duck, which is served tableside. It is marinated and roasted using locally sourced star-apple firewood, resulting in tender and flavorful meat with crispy skin. The duck can be enjoyed in four ways: skin and breast meat with leek and cucumber wrapped in a Chinese pancake; duck soup; minced duck wrapped in romaine lettuce; and deep-fried duck with salt and pepper.\n\nSmoki Moto delivers flavor and flair\n\nFor dinner, be treated to a breathtaking view of the Zambales mountain ranges and Mt. Arayat at Smoki Moto, which snagged the top spot on the Tripadvisor list -- and for good reason.\n\nAccording to Clark Marriott Hotel executive chef Robert Czeschka, whose culinary journey has traversed Michelin-starred restaurants and world-renowned hotels in various prestigious locations worldwide, boldness defines Smoki Moto -- from its scenic views on the 17th floor of the Clark Marriott Hotel that creates a picturesque backdrop for any occasion and the glass floors that offer a thrilling dining experience to the elevated flavors of every dish that leave a one-of-a-kind lasting impression.\n\nA full-service restaurant and bar known for its expertise in grilling premium black Angus beef over charcoal fires, Smoki Moto offers an authentic dining experience that celebrates rich flavors and boasts an impressive drink menu featuring a selection of premium wines, soju, beers, and craft cocktails.\n\n\"Smoki Moto aims to deliver an unforgettable dining experience by engaging all the senses,\" said Chef Robert. \"Our top-notch service ensures that every aspect of your dining experience is exceptional, from the moment you arrive until the last sip of your cocktail.\"\n\nTruly, the presentation (the gin thriller was served with a dramatic swirling of the glass cover, slowly letting the smoke seep out in incremental theatrical swooshes) and the styling of the plates make dining there incredibly gratifying. If you're looking for flavor and flair, it's the place to go.\n\nThe Korean-Japanese-American top-rated restaurant is also open to preparing special off-menu items upon request, when possible. Aside from great food and dining experience, Smoki Moto also champions sustainability.\n\n\"Sustainability is at the heart of everything we do. We prioritize sourcing ingredients from local suppliers who share our commitment to sustainable and ethical practices. By sourcing locally, we reduce our carbon footprint and support the local economy, while also ensuring the freshness and quality of our ingredients,\" the executive chef said.\n\nImmersing in European market culture at Markt\n\nSwissotel Clark's Markt is easily the standard for buffet breakfasts for anyone who has tried it, with its seemingly endless array of scrumptious morning fare that isn't limited to your typical idea of almusal. The all-day buffet restaurant brings the European market concept to Clark where you can have your pick of dishes and have them freshly cooked for you upon ordering. The range of hearty and healthy (even vegan) choices is mind-blowing. Who says you can't have sushi and ice cream for breakfast?\n\nBreakfast buffets are where one usually wishes they had two stomachs, but with Markt, you may need two or more spares. The variety of different types of breads and pastries alone is enough to overwhelm.\n\nAside from the usual cereals, pancakes, and toasts, there is also a strip of incredible Filipino breakfast fares like fried danggit, dilis and pusit, pork longganisa, beef tapa, and champorado. There are also international choices like congee, vegetable fritters, quinoa salad, chicken noodle soup, and curry. Markt really makes a compelling case for waking up early, taking it slowly, and just chilling while filling up the belly for the day ahead.\n\n'Fun dining' at romantic Ristorante di Verona\n\nRistorante di Verona by Swissotel Clark is endlessly Instagrammable: from its romantic \"Romeo and Juliet\"-inspired interiors to its exquisitely scrumptious offerings, and even the showmanship when serving its signature dishes, like the tomahawk and tiramisu.\n\nAccording to Chef Roald Schuur, Swiss\u00c3\u00b4tel Clark's culinary director, Ristorante di Verona offers a \"fun dining\" experience. \"Engagement is key,\" he said, explaining that chefs regularly come out for a chat, table presentations, or to seek feedback.\n\nThe open-kitchen layout itself gives diners insight into the heart of the restaurant as they watch how their food is prepared. \"We also have the Verona Brunch Club Sundays, where we aim to be the perfect venue for vibes, beats, and cheers. Both service staff and chefs make every dining experience for all guests special.\"\n\nChef Roald mentioned that Ristorante di Verona sources excellent local produce as much as possible to lower its carbon footprint, aiming to promote a sustainable culinary journey. \"However, as the nature of the restaurant has its roots in Italy, we do get various unique items from there.\" The chef added that the service and kitchen staff can work closely to accommodate guests' food restrictions.\n\nRistorante di Verona is particularly proud of having the most number of wine and grappa selections in the region. The alfresco area offers a picturesque view of the Zambales mountain range, which Chef Roald emphasized no other Italian restaurant in the region has.\n\nWith a sparklingly refreshing four seasons drink in hand, one is invited to dive in. For starters, the sourdough with olive oil and strawberry vinaigrette gives an interesting welcome -- the blend of sweet, tart, and earthy flavors is addicting.\n\nBut don't miss out on the pasta! Authentic carbonara really hits differently -- none of the heavy cream found in our localized version, but one that's light with the smokiness of the bacon shining through.\n\nFor the main show, the mouthwatering tomahawk served tableside is perfect for sharing, along with other Italian favorites like their seafood risotto oozing with tomato goodness and delightfully bright prosciutto pizza.\n\nTruly giving a \"dolce vita\" (sweet life) experience, Ristorante di Verona's tiramisu offers a delightful conclusion to any indulgent meal. Its decadently drenched creaminess orchestrates a smooth dance in the mouth, where the bitter notes of coffee and the gentle sweetness of the cream harmonize in a romantic symphony, leaving a lasting impression of culinary bliss.\n\nWith a broad array of delectable offerings awaiting exploration, Hann Resorts holds a wealth of lusciously appetizing choices for any guest's culinary adventure, which would take more than a brief weekend to savor fully. Its bold flavors, warm service, and inviting surroundings to ensure that \"goodbyes\" turn into \"see you agains\" with every visit.\n",

There, members of the revolutionary civil rights group hosted free meals for children and led classes, meetings and rallies\u2014including chapter chairman Fred Hampton\u2019s last speech before he was shot by police in December 1969.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe storied church\u2014known today as the Epiphany Center for the Arts, a multipurpose art and events center\u2014is now part of a unique historic preservation project.

Since 2019, the coalition of over sixty independent and local media groups has been managed by the Reader Institute for Community Journalism. On February 16, operational responsibility of CIMA was transferred to Public Narrative, a Chicago media resource.\n\nSolomon Lieberman of the Reader and Jhmira Alexander at Public Narrative convened a \u201cmembers-only\u201d call to discuss the transfer, but suppressed the guest list and chat, and kicked tough questions to promised \u201cone-on-ones.\u201d (Eventually they did note that twenty-one participants were on the call.) The stakes were outlined shortly after the online meeting in the CIMA Slack channel by McKinley Park News publisher Justin Kerr: \u201cAfter today\u2019s call, it really looks like CIMA is being hijacked by a nonprofit organization that\u2014like so many others\u2014is using the reputation and work of local news publishers like ourselves for their own agenda and benefit, without involving us, and in a way that creates massive conflicts of interest that our news is actually trustworthy and not manipulated by an advocacy marketing agenda.\n\n\u201cWe need an organization by publishers, for publishers: Not academics, foundation heads, \u2018experts,\u2019 \u2018consultants,\u2019 vendors, and nonprofits and their donors. The fact that CIMA (with Independent in its title) is now going to be used as a thrall of Public Narrative shows these folks have zero respect for us and Chicago\u2019s media industry. The call today further demonstrates their contempt for us: Allowing no discussion, Jhmira\u2019s inherent threat that we could either go along with what they\u2019ve decided (by fiat), or leave, etc. The only role that Public Narrative should have with CIMA is supporting the foundation of an independent membership organization.\u201d\n\nSkilling\u2019s Final Predictions\n\nOut like a lion\u2026 WGN-TV posts Tom Skilling\u2019s sign-off after forty-five years here.\n\nOprah Exits Weight Watchers\n\n\u201cOprah Winfrey is parting ways with Weight Watchers after nearly ten years on the company\u2019s board of directors,\u201d relays the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cWinfrey disclosed in December that she was using a prescription drug to manage her weight,\u201d which went against \u201cthe terms of her agreement with Weight Watchers.\u201d The New York Times: \u201cThe company announced the departure of its most famous spokeswoman in a corporate filing that sent the stock into a tailspin.\u201d The group posts that Winfrey will \u201cdonate financial interest in Weight Watchers to the National Museum of African American History and Culture.\u201d\n\n \n\nMUSIC\n\nWill Klaus M\u00e4kel\u00e4 Become The CSO\u2019s Youngest Music Director?\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s only conducted the Chicago Symphony once (returning in April), but the buzz is Klaus M\u00e4kel\u00e4 is a lock. If so, depending on the official date, he could be the CSO\u2019s youngest music director ever,\u201d cultural observer Lynn Becker tweets.\n\nSigur R\u00f3s And The Wordless Music Orchestra At Auditorium In September\n\nSigur R\u00f3s has added U.S. tour dates with a full orchestra, and the Chicago date is one where the group has not yet played with an orchestra.

        "text": "Andre Hill is a second-generation McDonald\u2019s owner-operator based in Columbus, Ohio. He became one of McDonald\u2019s newest owner-operators in December 2019, committed to moving the culture and providing opportunities in the communities he serves. Andre has created his own lane in the business through forward-thinking ideas, strategic planning, and continuous innovative tactics.\n\n\nHe took a break from his busy schedule to engage in a conversation with rolling out publisher and CEO Munson Steed. Here is their insightful conversation.\n\n\nMunson Steed: Ladies and gentlemen, this Munson Steed and welcome to another edition of CEO to CEO. I\u2019m so proud of this young man. He truly has studied the game. He understands what it is. He has a gold mind, he has a masterful mind, and he clearly is a student of what it is to make progress to invest in the community. He is a second-generation entrepreneur, my dear brother, Andre Hill, how are you?\n\nAndre Hill: Hey Appreciate it, man. We need to get some sound effects behind all that, you know, running. So we hear claps and everything. [woooo] Hell of an introduction man, I appreciate it.\n\n\nMS: When you think about the second generation. What it is to run an international brand of food and engagement of community at McDonald\u2019s, and understand that even where there is food inequity and individuals like you, if there weren\u2019t McDonald\u2019s in some hoods. In some locations, there may be no breakfast or no examples of black-owned businesses. Can you speak to that?\n\nAH: Yeah, I think it\u2019s, that\u2019s a really good question, man. It\u2019s actually twofold, you know, a lot of people get on McDonald\u2019s. They think our foods are or what should I say, less than quality of what have you, you know, in comparison to many references, even the black community you get on McDonald\u2019s. But one thing\u2019s for sure, McDonald\u2019s typically, the owner operators in the hood look like the folks in the hood. Typically, the owner operators in the hood are hiring from the hood, which is creating economy. And to your point, man, you know a lot of hoods are food deserts, you know. \n\nYou want to go and get potato chips and yo-yos, and ho-hos whatever, you know, down the street, and some and some pink lemonade then have that. But you know, if you really wanna a fresh cooked meal, right? The American classics: burgers, fries, shakes, what have you, you know, on a dessert, particularly your fancy. that you know where McDonald\u2019s is. Typically, you can come, you can walk to ride a bike or take a bus in our neighborhoods. And you know, another thing, you know, you brought up representation, you brought up exposure, you know.\n\nI\u2019ve had kids that look at me, and even my mom, for instance. You know, they look at us, says as auntie, uncle, you know the dad they never had. Somebody that they never saw before, that now they have. They understand places in life they can get to because of conversation that we have, right? They see a black man owning the business of which the one of the largest corporations in the world has founded. And so you know, point in case, both sides to that coin man. There\u2019s no benefit like this being a black owner operator, being able to impact the communities that we serve.\n\nMS: You know, when you think of a Jim Thrower and who has truly created Nextgen, multiple cities. What\u2019s it like as a younger black man to be able to see a role model, who if you choose to? Can have 30 stores or across the country. What\u2019s that feel like as a CEO?\n\nAH: Yeah. It feels incredible, honestly. And you talk, you bring up Mr. Thrower. He\u2019s somebody that\u2019s impacted me gratefully, you know, before I even came to help my mom run this family-owned business. I worked for him for a whole year while I worked in corporate America. Because time after time, kid after kid, Jim and Mrs. Thrower, you know. They have created an enterprise that did not just include them, and they didn\u2019t force their kids to get into the business. But their kids understood, because the matriculation that they had going through, you know, being kids wiping off tables have responsibilities at the restaurant. They understood what generational wealth really meant to the black community. \n\nAnd so a city like Detroit, right? You know the Throwers? Everybody knows the Throwers. If they know them personally or not. They have had some sort of impact with them, whether it\u2019s their cousins, their brothers, their sisters, teachers, schools that they go to, right? The impact is felt. And so, seeing what the Throwers have done for not just that first generation, but the second generation, gave me the manuscript, gave me the layout, the blueprint of what I can do. You know, further and beyond even what they have created for their family.\n\nMS: You know, for most people that may not know it but you know, you decided to get an MBA. Why and how do you apply your MBA to being a CEO now of the Hill organization?\n\nAH: I got an MBA. So when I was a kid, I always knew I was going to go to college but because I\u2019m around people, you know, that that have mentored me, people that run in circles such as you Munson and you know, I\u2019ve been able to see just what black excellence looks like, and how people have been able to garner black wealth that come from nothing, right? I felt like it was remiss for me to not use my opportunities and use the doors that I\u2019ve been able to to have open for me for my support system and kick more doors down to enhance my skill set, enhance my knowledge base, so that I can still continue to carry this torch and pull more people up like folks like you have done for me. \n\nAnd so, not only did I want to do that for us but myself. You know, no matter what facet in life I\u2019m in, right? I can buy all the jewels, I can buy all the cars, I can buy all the shoes and that can be taken from me. But you know what cannot be taken from me, my knowledge, my skill sets, you know, what\u2019s up here. And so, whether it\u2019s been corporate America or running my family-owned business. I have been able to add instant impact in whatever facet of business I\u2019ve been in ever since I received my MBA. \n\nOne of the best, one of the best choices ever made in my life was to go and get an MBA. And it was during actually, you know, what really made me do it when I did? The market was flat back then when I got it. Was like that \u2026 like 2007, 2008. Nobody was hiring, and I\u2019m like, you know, I could go try to get a job. Get a lower paying job, you know, which I\u2019m probably doing a lot more for inadequate pay or why don\u2019t I just take this time while the economy is down and go pursue my MBA. So, when I get out, you know, I can kick some butt.\n\nMS: You know, family-owned businesses. How important is it for us to create in a general way, in a generational wealth through family-owned businesses?\n\nAH: Well, that\u2019s the only way we\u2019re gonna be able to get ahead. You know, we are consumers. White people know it. Asians know it. You know, we are not, we were not trained in a sense, I would say, from us coming over to America the way that we were brought here. We were not trained, in a sense, to be owners, to be leaders, to be those of economical power. You know our spending power is far greater than anybody else\u2019s, but watch us, our buying power is because all we do is spend our money, you know. So, in order for us to retrain our focus, we have to be able to understand that we will not ever get our families ahead if we do not have ownership in something. Therefore, once we can get our families ahead, then we can start to work on our ecosystem as a people. \n\nYou see it time and time again, you know. Jewish communities, right? They\u2019re not dependent upon other folks. They could probably shop with themselves and you know, just interchange their money 10 times over, right? They don\u2019t care if I\u2019m gonna come purchase from them. Because they know that they\u2019ve created an ecosystem in which the economy is always going to generate some sort of income for everybody that chooses to participate in that economy. Arabs, you know. I come from a city where we have a lot of Eastern Europeans. We have a lot of Middle Easterners. And even when I\u2019m at in Columbus, I see a lot of Eastern Africans, you know these, and they\u2019re black. But they don\u2019t have, they have different mind sets than us because they come from somewhere else. Right? \n\nThey come from a foreign territory where things are not given, things are not expected, and they know what it takes in order to build wealth, and how important is for them to build it for their communities. And so we need to take on some of these aspects and start functioning in some of these ways, so that we can really enhance Black America. If we don\u2019t start doing it now man, we about to be broke.\n\nMS: About to be broke. There\u2019s a whole movement during black history. You have been a true celebration, not that you don\u2019t. Obviously, we both celebrate, rolling out 365, McDonald\u2019s 365. So that\u2019s not new. \n\nAH: Black and positivity golden?\n\nMS: Black and positively golden but 100%. You also empower, and I think that people don\u2019t understand the suppliers. So, you\u2019ve picked to collaborate with a young brother? Why did you choose to collaborate in our community and create expressions that will enhance our community\u2019s relationship? And can you kind of share with us? What that collaboration looks like and feels like, and why you chose the young entrepreneur to collaborate with?\n\nAH: Yeah. So, this is the second time around that I have collaborated with a black owned clothing brand to bring about merchandise for Black History Month. Between my family-owned McDonald\u2019s and a dirt label. We have collaborated, like I said, to bring merch for Black History month. We started this in 2019, I believe, before COVID hit and this is the first time again that we\u2019re doing it after that. \n\nBut it\u2019s important that we support each other. I mean, like, yeah, I could have probably had any company collaborate with me to make a design but the passion, the understanding, the speak, the culture, right? None of that stuff would be conveyed if it wasn\u2019t a black company that I collaborated with in order to bring about an incredible Black History Month campaign.\n\nMS: You know. You say that, but you\u2019re bringing it to places where young people may not have access to understanding the positive gift of being around an entrepreneur like you. Why are you so committed, Andre? To making sure that young people in places like a Columbus, it\u2019s different in a Detroit where, you know, literally, there\u2019s not only a Jim Thrower, there\u2019s a Joni Thrower, there\u2019s a ton of Bill Picard.\n\nWhole group of lighthouses lit up the sky in a Detroit. So, it\u2019s not a big thing for Austin to say. I walked in Munson\u2019s office, and I was with him. He sees that, that success. Why is it important to bring the light as an entrepreneur, and CEO to places like Columbus, and even some of those outside of Columbus that really would have never seen you or the merch to walk through?\n\nAH: So, to your point, the examples aren\u2019t there. I was lucky enough to be born in a place. I was born in Flint, Michigan, raised in Detroit, raised around black people that were really getting to the dollar, whether it was corporate America or their own businesses. But you know, outside of places like Detroit, Atlanta, your Chicagos, your Houstons, you know, to see a black person in ownership of anything is rare. \n\nWhen I moved to, when I moved to Ohio, I did not know, I didn\u2019t understand. You know, the significant differences of where I came from versus what most of America actually looks like, you know. And so, it\u2019s important that again, the communities that we serve, the people that I\u2019m able to expose to such things as black ownership. They understand that we are able to create, we are able to embrace, we\u2019re able to celebrate who we are and they, you know, we should be celebrated.\n\nMS: Lastly, there was a young man who needed a suit. Maybe I don\u2019t know why. What made you buy a young man who was heading to college a suit?\n\nAH: Man! It\u2019s just necessary. I\u2019m not the type of person that, I look at things from a full-circle perspective. I could\u2019ve given him some money, right? What would he do with it? In forward thinking, a suit is going to go much further than a couple $100, even if I gave him a thousand. Because that 1,000 will be used up right then and there. When he has to go on his interviews for internships, he\u2019s going to use that suit. When he has to go on interviews for a real job, when he\u2019s upon graduation, he\u2019s going to use that suit. If he has to interface with professionals, career centers, right? Committees, what have you? He\u2019s going to need that suit. \n\nAnd I know that\u2019s something that a lot of young black men first off, if they don\u2019t have their fathers in their lives, or black men that have even worn a suit or tied a tie, right? These are things that they just won\u2019t ever think about, you know. Even with me, talking to young black dudes about cutting off the \u2014 what they call that? \u2014 the tag that\u2019s usually on the arm. You know what I mean, brothers I see at a business event, you notice, still got the tag on it. They sharp though, but they don\u2019t realize well \u2026 that you know just simple things like that man. \n\nIt could make or break that first impression, it could make or break you know, just there. What should I say? Their inner strength because people might be looking at them, dogging them. you know, turn them down just because some simple they don\u2019t know to take this tag off, right?\n\nMS: Lastly, if you were given a speech at AU or Michigan State to the graduates about being a CEO, what would you challenge them to do as CEOs of the future?\n\nAH: Of the future? Man, I would just challenge them to never get tunnel vision. Never get tunnel vision. If you don\u2019t, if you can\u2019t see things outside of the purview that you think are important. Then you\u2019re gonna stop your growth and you will get passed up by those who can.\n\nMS: Cool! Thank you, this has been great. We\u2019ve got one of my favorite young CEOs, who are truly mastering the game of being there. Second-generation McDonald\u2019s owner, big ups to the Hill family, the whole family, and much love, obviously to the McDonald\u2019s Corporation for continuing to encourage black ownership of franchisees, and for those who have shined a light like a Jim Thrower, where we know there wasn\u2019t one before he took the torch. He and his wife, I should say Mrs. Thrower, a big part of it and shout out to your mom, Andre, for all that she continues to do in the community as well. I\u2019m Munson Steed and this has been CEO to CEO with Andre Hill.\n\nAH: Thank you, man. Let\u2019s get [those] sound effects going.",

        "text": "An authentic Japanese restaurant has celebrated its fifth anniversary - as the owner reveals plans to sell up and downsize.\n\nAuradaze, in Ambleside, offers customers a 'slice of Japan' including carefully selected ingredients from long-trusted suppliers across the globe in Kobe, Yokohama.\n\nInspired by his passion for Japanese cuisine and culture, head chef Darren Yates built a unique dining experience and brought it to the Lake District.\n\nThere are no menus to choose from at Auradaze. Instead customers are asked to observe Omakase and 'trust the chef'.\n\nThe restaurant is currently up for sale as Darren is looking to downsize with a plan to offer an even more intimate Japanese experience for people. He wants to stay in the Lakes and said his 'eyes are always open for a new opportunity'.\n\nDarren spent five years in Japan during which he studied and classically trained in the art of Japanese cuisine before starting his own restaurant. He opened the 13th Japanese restaurant in the whole UK in Wilmslow, which grew rapidly and was followed by shops and delis.\n\nDue to a focus on quality ingredients, Darren began importing produce from Kobe and Yokohama and even flying fish in from all over the world to ensure the authenticity of his dishes, which he observes to this day.\n\nDelving deeper into his passion for food, Darren looked into the micro biology of Japanese food and began teaching students at Manchester University.\n\nDarren was attached to the UK Trade & Industry and Foodexpo Japan while producing ready meals for exportation to Belgium and France before he decided to sell his restaurant and travel to Bora Bora.\n\nIn the south Pacific he served many famous faces and worked with some eminent names in Istanbul until he decided to return to the UK.\n\nDarren aims to allow the individual to fully immerse themselves in Japanese culture by encouraging customers to share the experience with fellow diners. He said: \"For me this really is the essence of Japanese food, being accompanied with good conversation and many shared memories.\"\n\nOn Tuesday March 12, the restaurant celebrated its five year anniversary. Darren said: \"I've been in the game a long time, I've worked all over the world and came up to the Lakes to semi-retire, the time was right to move to Ambleside. It's a lovely place, the footfall is amazing, everyone comes out of the wild and needs something to eat.\n\n\"I call it 'Mini Canada', you forget what's on your doorstep, sometimes you work inside in the kitchen all day then step out to see the sunset, and you just think 'wow', it gets taken for granted.\"",

        "text": "TAGBILARAN CITY -- Tourists will have to pay more when dining in floating restaurants while cruising along Loboc River, a popular destination in Bohol province.\n\nAn advisory released by the Loboc municipal tourism office on Monday showed that starting April 1, the regular river cruise rate of P850 would go up to P1,000 per tourist.\n\nA discounted rate of P800 would be given to senior citizens while children who are below 3 feet would be free of charge. Children between 3 feet and 4 feet tall would be charged P412 each while those above 4 feet would pay the full rate.\n\nThe river cruise rate includes a lunch buffet and a stopover to watch local performers singing and dancing.\n\nREAD: Loboc river's water level subsides after reaching critical level\n\nA popular destination, the 2-kilometer cruise runs for about an hour, starting from neighboring Loay town. It stops midway to allow visitors to watch a short performance of singers and dancers in traditional baro't saya. Once it reaches Busai Falls, the floating restaurant turns around and heads back to its origin.\n\nThe planned increase received some backlash on social media. Netizens noted that the rate increase was ill-timed, especially that local officials had yet to resolve the controversy surrounding the illegal structures built within the Chocolate Hills (See related story on this page).In a statement, the Loboc Bohol Tourism, the local tourism office, said the price increase was \"essential.\"\n\n\"Both the local government of Loboc and the Association of Loboc Floating Restaurant Operators (Alfro) are doing their best to provide the necessary improvements for the Loboc River Cruise to be globally competitive,\" it said.\n\nThere have been increases in the operational costs, including the price of fresh ingredients, which the commissary sources locally \"to ensure the finest quality in our dishes,\" it said.\n\n\"We are committed to supporting our local suppliers, and unfortunately, they too are dealing with rising costs ... We believe in investing in our staff as well. This means providing them with regular training to enhance their skills and improve the service they provide. We also believe in paying our staff a fair salary for their hard work,\" it added.\n\nThe statement said Alfro also had to invest in the maintenance and improvement of the floating restaurants. They had to build 10 more boats to replace those destroyed during Typhoon \"Odette\" in 2021.",

        "text": "Cayman\u2019s economy is almost totally reliant on its financial services industry, which dwarfs tourism and construction as the principal breadwinner for the jurisdiction, according to a new analysis.\n\nThe level of reliance on the sector is a key vulnerability for the islands\u2019 financial future, which is highlighted in a detailed assessment by Caribbean economist Marla Dukharan.\n\n\nMarla Dukharan, speaking at the Kimpton Seafire Resort last year. \u2013 Photo: James Whittaker\nIn her report, she argues for a concentrated focus on education and training alongside a skills-gap assessment to ensure Caymanians can play a bigger role in the \u201cknowledge-based economy\u201d of the future.\n\nAnd she questions the wisdom of investing further in tourism and construction \u2013 industries which she argues rely heavily on imported labour and materials. She also argues for greater focus on protecting the environment, as an economic resource for Cayman.\n\nThe report \u2013 Unleashing Cayman\u2019s Potential: A Journey Towards Prosperity And Unity \u2013 challenges the \u201cwidely held belief\u201d that tourism and construction are essential drivers of growth in Cayman.\n\n- Advertisement -\nGNC Live Well - Fuel your fitness with protein - Come visit us to discover what's new\nShe suggests there are diminishing returns to focusing on these sectors.\n\n\u201cNot all growth is equal,\u201d Dukharan writes.\n\n\u201cThe current growth patterns in Cayman have painted a dual narrative \u2013 a remarkable tale of economic development on one hand, and on the other, a growing set of social challenges.\n\n\u201cThe rhythm of Cayman\u2019s physical development, if left unchecked, threatens to amplify the social and environmental outcomes that Caymanians seek to avoid.\n\n\u201cSocial deterioration as evidenced by rising crime, traffic jams, and pollution for example, can undermine the very economic progress Caymanians have worked so hard to secure.\u201d\n\nShe suggests slowing the pace of physical development and being \u201cmore deliberate\u201d about the location, sustainability and resilience of such development.\n\n\u201cCayman must grow, but she must grow more carefully and more equitably to create a future where no Caymanian is left behind,\u201d she concludes.\n\nHere we look at some of the key conclusions from her report.\n\nUnemployment is not the problem\n\nWhile political rhetoric often focuses on job creation, the report emphasises that this is not a major issue for Cayman.\n\nThe unemployment rate among local people is among the lowest in the world and any new project that promises job growth will inevitably require imported labour.\n\n\u201cThe labour force participation rate in Cayman is probably the highest in the region, which means there is less idleness and less informality in the economy \u2013 all of which is positive,\u201d the report states.\n\n\u201cCayman is the only country in the region where unemployment is not a problem. Cayman imports most of its labour \u2013 from janitors to judges \u2013 and the unemployment rate in Cayman is usually the lowest in the Caribbean.\u201d\n\nQuality of jobs is a much bigger issue\n\nCaymanians are, however, under-represented in higher paying jobs, Dukharan argues.\n\nShe attributes this to education and training attainment, pointing out that the academic record of Cayman\u2019s public education system is at odds with the level of investment going into it.\n\nCiting reports that only 27% of primary school students and 37.5% of secondary school students achieve expected standards, she warns that this is contributing to Cayman out-sourcing its highest paid and highest sought jobs.\n\n\u201cCaymanians mostly occupy the middle-to-low-wage jobs, rather than the higher-wage positions. From what I am able to discern by talking to employers \u2013 and the education data supports this \u2013 there is simply a shortage of appropriately skilled Caymanians to fill the high-skilled, higher-wage posts.\u201d\n\nSkills, training and education focus needed\n\nWhile investment does not seem to be the issue, Dukharan believes more focus is needed to establish the causes and reverse the trend of poor academic outcomes in government schools.\n\n\u201cUnless this problem is addressed meaningfully and with urgency, we may see the job positions held and wages earned by Caymanians suffer over time,\u201d she says.\n\nArguing that Cayman\u2019s best economic growth potential is in \u201cknowledge-based\u201d sectors that bring higher paying jobs, she suggests this will become more of an imperative over time.\n\n\u201cWhat Cayman needs now is to deliberately accelerate the shift towards more highly educated and, therefore, more highly paid Caymanians.\u201d\n\nTechnical and vocational education is a key part of this, she suggests, pointing out the high proportion of work permits in well-paid trades.\n\nRising inequality\n\nDukharan cites concerns that Cayman\u2019s economic success is not being shared by everyone.\n\n\u201cThe inequality and poverty level in Cayman manifest anecdotally in many ways \u2013 the apparent rise in crime, the uproar about the rising cost of living, the limited availability of affordable housing for Caymanians, the massive social impact that rising interest rates have had on the lives of Caymanians, for example\u2026\u201d\n\n\nTraffic is one area where Cayman\u2019s quality of life has declined as the economy has grown.\nOne area where she argues the divide is most stark is home ownership.\n\nCiting pension raids and Christmas bonuses for civil servants as examples of unsustainable one-off windfalls that do little to address the core issue, she argues that not enough attention has been paid to policy interventions.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to make a deliberate effort to measure Cayman\u2019s inequality and poverty and to implement solutions to ensure that the growth everyone prizes so dearly is more widely and more evenly distributed among Caymanians.\u201d\n\nTourism may not be key pillar it once was\n\nAny analysis of Cayman\u2019s economy has typically considered two pillars \u2013 financial services and tourism \u2013 with construction a supplementary third sector.\n\nBut Dukharan argues that with almost 10,000 work permits in the restaurant, accommodation, wholesale and retail sectors and a heavy reliance on imports, Cayman\u2019s tourism industry is sending as much cash overseas as it is bringing into the island.\n\nWhile the islands do net hundreds of millions of dollars in annual income from tourism, she argues that this is spent on salaries for an imported workforce (that is often sent off-island via remittances) and on imported food and materials to overseas suppliers to provide the infrastructure.\n\n\nTourism may not be the money spinner many believe it to be, argues Dukharan.\nThe locally supplied \u2018product\u2019 she suggests, is the beaches and island environment that attracts those visitors.\n\n\u201cBut if Cayman continues growing the tourism sector, which requires more and more physical space, more hotels, bringing in more and more people, and generating more and more waste and pollution, we risk jeopardizing the very culture and natural environment which are the only major domestic input into the tourism sector.\u201d\n\nIn that context, she suggests tourism is bringing as many negative impacts as positive and that government should \u201cavoid further subsidising the sector\u201d until it can definitely determine that is not a \u201cnet fiscal and foreign exchange drain\u201d.\n\nCayman needs to rethink its \u2018construction addiction\u2019\n\nConstruction has often been cited as a possible third pillar of the Cayman economy, with the obvious caveat that it is intrinsically linked to the other two.\n\nBuilding hotels, homes and offices can only be a driver of jobs and economic growth if there are tourists and white-collar workers to fill them.\n\nWhile acknowledging the enduring positive influence of the construction sector across Cayman, she questions if it is focused on the right areas and if it is a sustainable driver of growth over the longer term.\n\n\nCayman\u2019s \u2018construction addiction\u2019 could have diminishing returns over time.\nUnless Cayman\u2019s leaders make a conscious decision to become the Caribbean\u2019s Manhattan or Singapore, she suggests development will have to become more considered and strategic.\n\n\u201cThere are limits to the positive impact that construction can have on the economy. When Mount Trashmore is the highest point on Grand Cayman, and when on this tiny island we can spend an hour in traffic, and when there is little space left to construct affordable housing, and when so much airtime and attention is devoted to the unaffordable cost of living, we know Cayman has reached the point of diminishing returns to \u2018growth\u2019 via more and more construction to serve more and more tourists and an exploding population.\u201d\n\nReliance on financial services leaves Cayman vulnerable\n\nFinancial services and linked professional services, including accounting and legal professions, account for a third of the island\u2019s GDP and a third of government spending.\n\nBut the sector is facing \u201cever increasing\u201d threats from a host of international bodies that have targeted the island on a variety of watchlists. While she describes this process as \u201cbiased and unjustified\u201d, Dukharan praises government\u2019s approach to defending Cayman\u2019s reputation internationally.\n\n \n\n\u201cWithout the license fees paid by the financial services sector, the Government will generate a fiscal deficit every year, and will have to borrow to pay its bills. The financial services sector therefore, in effect, subsidizes everything else in the economy \u2013 including tourism,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThis strength is also a weakness, however, leaving Cayman\u2019s entire economic well-being at risk if something goes wrong in that sector.\n\n\u201cTourism isn\u2019t quite the goose laying the golden egg that many believe it is, and I think it is safe to say that while financial services is producing a bounty of golden eggs, these are really the only solid eggs in Cayman\u2019s basket. And this makes Cayman fiscally and economically vulnerable.\u201d\n\nKnowledge is power (and wealth)\n\nIf construction and tourism are unsustainable and financial services is under threat, where does that leave Cayman?\n\nDukharan advises fiscal prudence on the part of government to provide leeway for any shocks in its own budget.\n\nAnd she suggests room for growth in \u201cknowledge-based sectors\u201d which take \u201cless space and ecological impact and can generate more desirable job opportunities for Caymanians compared to tourism.\u201d\n\nBecause of its \u201cgold standard\u201d financial services sector, she says Cayman has a head start in this area and can expand further into intellectual property and technology.\n\nBut she emphasises the island needs to transform its education outcomes to ensure no one is left behind .\n\n\u201cIt would be easier to diversify more deeply into knowledge-based sectors in Cayman, which have lower physical and ecological footprints and higher wages \u2013 and the key to this is education.\n\n\u201cWhat Cayman needs now is to deliberately accelerate the shift towards more highly educated and, therefore, more highly paid Caymanians.\u201d",

Only their inner circle of family are allowed to know -- and they have an interest in keeping quiet since they often tag along to meals to avert suspicion.\n\nThe most common cover story that inspectors give their friends and wider family is that they are \"consulting\" with restaurants on their business strategies -- a good excuse to travel and indulge.\n\nThey give false names and even change their phone numbers when making reservations -- vital since many restaurants now have applications to scan their bookings for journalists and potential inspectors.\n\nThe reviews require an excellent memory. The inspector must recall the tiniest details of the food, service and ambiance -- right down to the appearance of the toilets -- without taking notes, though phone pictures are now common.\n\nThey must also research the wider context -- the restaurant's suppliers, how it fits into the local community and its finances.\n\nThe final report sticks to five criteria: the quality of the ingredients, the culinary technique, the harmony of the flavours, the emotion which the chef is seeking to convey through their menu, and the restaurant's consistency over time. The latter requires multiple visits.\n\nThe awarding of a star -- with three stars as the absolute pinnacle -- must be a unanimous choice when inspectors meet to discuss their reviews.\n\nIf there is disagreement, further visits are organised until a consensus is reached.",

One of the worlds ...\n\nAuckland, NZ: After years of hope and speculation from Kiwis, Popeyes\u00c2\u00ae, the original Louisiana fried chicken, is finally making its way to New Zealand.

        "text": "In May of 1964, Congress famously declared bourbon a \"distinctive product\" of the U.S. By that point, America's \"native spirit\" had been produced -- both legally and illicitly -- for two centuries. And nowhere did the spirit have more of an impact than Kentucky, where bourbon is now a $9 billion industry, and where (according to a much-repeated, unverified estimate) more than 90 percent of the world's supply is produced.\n\nTwo months after that official declaration about bourbon, Congress passed a much more landmark piece of legislation: the Civil Rights Act. It was a coincidence that both happened in the same summer. Still, as American society slowly started to racially integrate, the ownership class of the Kentucky bourbon industry evolved even slower. There had been African Americans in the industry since its inception: from enslaved people working stills in the 1800s, all the way to Bourbon Hall of Fame member and Buffalo Trace tour guide Freddie Johnson becoming a widely recognized figure in the industry. But in terms of distillery ownership, the demographics remained stubbornly white for generations.\n\nHalf a century after that summer of 1964, the needle has edged forward slightly. According to the Distillery Trail, which maintains a directory of 2,000-plus U.S. distilleries, 45 are Black-owned, with three of those in Kentucky. One, Rivulet Liqueur, focuses on an artisan pecan liqueur, while the other two, Brough Brothers in Louisville and Fresh Bourbon in Lexington, are gaining ground in the bourbon space. Both of those brands are fighting for a foothold -- and a slice of the sales and tourism revenue generated by the $9 billion industry that white-owned companies have dominated for so long. It's no simple feat.\n\n\"Some of these families have been around for 150 years,\" says Brough Brothers CEO Victor Yarbrough. \"Their names are on the buildings now. If you have a 100-year head start, you're going to be in control. ... Eventually, times start to change, laws change, societal norms change, and it's acceptable for a Black family to own a distillery. Not saying it's an easy path.\"\n\nMaking a splash in an already saturated space like Kentucky bourbon is difficult enough. To do it as part of an historically marginalized group has its own challenges. In an industry that can have such a high financial barrier to entry -- costs of distilling equipment, property, supplies, permitting, etc. -- a lack of access to capital stops many potential owners before they even start. In this context, there's specific, entrenched history for Black owners to overcome. The racial wealth gap in the U.S. is still significant. For every $100 in wealth of a white household, Black households only hold $15, according to 2022 data from the Brookings Institution.\n\nThat gap can be exacerbated by neighborhood, too. In the Yarbrough brothers' home neighborhood, the West End of Louisville, poverty rates are much higher than the city's east side. Growing up, the Yarbrough family wasn't in dire straits. But they also weren't strangers to eating tuna sandwiches when money was tight. When Victor and his two brothers, Christian and Bryson, launched their bourbon brand, they pooled their money, along with their spouses', to self-fund everything. Victor, who had worked in finance for several large banks, quit his job to start the business -- and went back to tuna sandwiches for a while until it was off the ground.\n\nFor most potential business owners without generational wealth, loans are the next option. And in 1977, legislation was passed to fight racial discrimination in lending. But a gap has remained there, too. According to the 2021 Small Business Credit Survey, Black business owners are more likely to be denied loans compared to white owners. Only 27 percent of Black business owners considered low-risk applicants received full funding that year, compared to 43 percent for whites.\n\n\"I've always known if I had good credit, pay my bills, have a little money in the bank, no problem getting a loan,\" says Tia Edwards, who founded Fresh Bourbon with husband Sean. \"Banking in the bourbon industry ... it's different for Sean and I, being African American. It's the same thing for some women-owned businesses; when they walk into a bank, you're looked at differently.\"\n\n\"When I started to go to different distilleries to see if they would work with us, there weren't too many, if any, African Americans in the front office.\"\n\nThat's especially frustrating for someone like Sean, who does have family history in the spirits world -- albeit outside the margins. As a kid, he would visit his grandfather in Brucetown, a historically Black neighborhood in Lexington. At 9, Sean helped count money and clean bottles for his grandfather's business: bootlegging liquor. But that family history didn't turn into a deed for a million-dollar company Sean could take over as an adult.\n\n\"I'd probably (already) be in the distilling business if my grandfather was distilling instead of bootlegging,\" Sean says. \"But he wouldn't have had that opportunity.\"\n\nBeyond financial capital, there's also Rolodex capital: Who do you know already working in bourbon? And how do you make inroads in an industry where it's difficult to find many who look like you?\n\n\"When I started to go to different distilleries to see if they would work with us, there weren't too many, if any, African Americans in the front office,\" says Victor, who started a spirits import/export business before Brough Brothers. \"I might see guys moving pallets around and when they see me walk through with the guys from the front office, they're like, 'Who is this guy?'\"\n\nIt's an image the Kentucky Distillers' Association (KDA) is working to diversify. On the front end of distilling career development, the KDA has funded scholarships for underrepresented students at three universities (Kentucky, Louisville, and Kentucky State). Further down the line, the KDA offers a diversity toolkit to help existing distilleries hire more diverse workers and identify minority-owned suppliers.\n\nThere are fewer resources or programs to stimulate diversity within that space in the middle: starting a new distillery. Meanwhile, much of the industry's ownership has simply been in the game for generations.\n\n\"I think we have some work to do on being able to show up to a distillery, have a visitor's experience in the Kentucky Bourbon Trail, and see yourself there,\" says Sara Barnes, KDA's director of industry responsibility and sustainability. \"There's a lot of heritage and history and recipes -- family-owned businesses passed down for generations.\"\n\nThe rise of the craft movement, with its smaller barrier to entry, has helped. Victor points to some of the legislation the KDA has pushed that's allowed smaller players to get started, like allowing tasting rooms.\n\nAnother challenge, though, for Black-owned distilleries is the potential to be pigeonholed as a \"Black brand.\" At Fresh, the Edwardses set their sights on the restaurant space. Tia never liked drinking bourbon straight -- she even used to pull ginger ale out of her purse on Bourbon Trail experiences years earlier. So when she and Sean started developing their mash bill for Fresh, they wanted a flavor that could easily be mixed in a cocktail -- maybe paired with a nice dinner. But the couple has struggled to get Fresh on local menus (it's on about 10 now). The feedback hasn't always been about flavor.\n\n\"We've been told, 'Oh, maybe this is a bourbon just for African American people, so maybe I can get that market,'\" Tia says. \"But this is a bourbon for everyone. We are African American, that's great, but it's bourbon, and it's a gold medal-winning bourbon.\"\n\nTo combat that segmentation, according to Sean, \"The only way to do it is we outgrow it. We grow to a point ... where we're recognized and seen not just as African Americans in the bourbon industry, but ... we're major players.\"\n\nOn the retail side, Black-owned brands also need distributors to consistently purchase their spirits, not just when it's good public relations to do so. This showed up especially in 2020, when nationwide -- then worldwide -- protests about police violence against people of color reached a fever pitch. Louisville was one epicenter of that outcry: Metro Police killed 26-year-old Breonna Taylor in her home during a botched raid. As protests accelerated nationwide, a larger conversation about racial equity grew. Companies pledged support to Black-owned brands, and there were calls from consumers for more support of Black-owned products.\n\n\"In the next five years, we would love to be a top-10 bourbon,\" Sean Edwards says. \"We're not in this to just play around with it. We're in it to go to the highest level possible. We believe we can do that.\"\n\nVictor Yarbrough saw some of that push in the spirits world, at least initially. Because of his background in imports/exports, he'd already spent several years building relationships with distributors. So when retailers requested more Black-owned liquor brands, distributors already knew Brough Brothers, and they were ready to step up. (Brough Brothers is available in about 25 states; some of that distribution was in place before 2020.)\n\nFor retail diversity to stick around, those orders have to keep coming -- even when there aren't protests on the news every night. The momentum on that front has stalled, Victor says.\n\n\"We've had some talks behind the scenes with other African American-owned spirits, brands, and distilleries, and they've noticed it as well,\" Yarbrough says. \"You kind of have to hit it while the iron is hot. It's slowed down quite a bit. If it was at 100 then, it's probably at 40 now.\"\n\nAfrican Americans may only recently have gotten feet in the ownership door of the bourbon industry. But their fingerprints are all over the door handle. Like with other major industries in the South, slave labor is a crucial piece of the bourbon industry's history. In recent years, that story is being unearthed and recognized. Kayla Bush is one Black researcher at the University of Kentucky digging into decades of records to establish names and contributions of enslaved people in bourbon's early years.\n\n\"It's kind of disheartening knowing it started that way, and we worked our way from that,\" Bush says. \"It's really hard to work our way back into it when the industry has made it to this level.\"\n\nAs that research (some funded by KDA grants), continues to shine light on Kentucky bourbon's past, brands like Fresh and Brough Brothers are working to write its future chapters. Both have broken historical barriers within a behemoth industry in their home state. And both have big plans. In Lexington, the Edwardses are fundraising for a 30,000-square-foot distilling facility. They'll also keep their current downtown tasting room and small distillery open.\n\n\"In the next five years, we would love to be a top-10 bourbon,\" Sean Edwards says. \"We're not in this to just play around with it. We're in it to go to the highest level possible. We believe we can do that.\"\n\nIn Louisville, Brough Brothers has started construction on a second location downtown, near Whiskey Row. They hope to open the 14,000-square-foot space by Derby weekend. They'll also start taking on outside investors, and open the new facility to contract distilling.\n\nMeanwhile, they're sticking with their roots -- and keeping the current West End location open: \"Growing up, this is the only neighborhood that supported me,\" says Bryson, the brand's master distiller. \"For me to not support them would be a travesty.\"\n\nTo do that, Brough Brothers employs six part-time employees, including three from the neighborhood. They want to expand their own brand -- but also help their neighbors build valuable skills within an industry that brings billions in economic impact to Kentucky. And a long-term hope? That there will be a wider crack in the door for future Black bourbon entrepreneurs in their home state.\n\n\"It's a combination of things: people realizing, 'Hey, in general African Americans built this country but don't necessarily have the economic base they should have,\" Victor Yarbrough says. \"They don't have that 100-year head start. ... It's about parity. Just get us within 50 years. I think that's what you're seeing, more opportunities for parity. But people have to be ready for the opportunities as well.\"",

Instead, they're made from breaded chicken breast.\nThey're more like \"oversized nuggets,\" one wing-shop owner told BI.\n\nSome chicken-wing shops offer customers a choice of what cut of the bird to get: bone-in or boneless wings.\n\nBut International Wing Factory in New York City doesn't describe them as boneless wings, preferring to simply call them boneless chicken.\n\n\"I always wrote 'boneless' on my menu because being a chef, I know there is nothing called boneless wings,\" owner Deepak Ballaney told Business Insider. For a de-boned wing, customers would have to pay $6 or $7 a wing to cover the labor involved, he said.\n\nBoneless wings, instead, are typically made from strips or chunks of chicken breast meat which are breaded, fried, and coated in sauce or a dry rub. Rather than being anything like wings, they're \"oversized nuggets,\" Ballaney said.\n\nBreast meat is cheaper because chickens only have 2 wings\nSoaring demand for chicken wings in recent years has pushed up prices and made it harder for restaurants to get their hands on supplies.\n\nBoneless wings aren't wings at all, they're just 'oversized nuggets' \u2014 but restaurants love them because they're cheaper and easier to produce\nSweet-potato fries, boneless wings, and bone-in wings from Wingstop.Grace Dean/Business Insider\n\"A bird only has two wings, whereas breast meat, you can feed them more, and you can add more breast meat to a bird,\" Jon Tower, an analyst at Citi covering restaurants, told Business Insider. \"There's just more supply of breast meat out there.\"\n\nSo-called boneless wings can also be easier to process because you don't have to deconstruct the bird as much, Tower said.\n\nBecause they're cheaper to buy, wing shops sometimes sell boneless wings for less. Wingstop's prices vary by location, but some of its restaurants charge more for \"classic\" wings than boneless, while others charge the same for both types.\n\nBoneless wings aren't wings at all, they're just 'oversized nuggets' \u2014 but restaurants love them because they're cheaper and easier to produce\nOne Wingstop restaurant in Rochester Hills, Michigan charges $12.49 for 10 classic wings and $10.29 for the same number of boneless wings.Wingstop\nBoneless wings don't get sauce everywhere\nBoneless wings can be easier for diners to eat, too.\n\n\"I think consumers are pretty happy with it because it gives them just a choice,\" Tower said. Plus bone-in wings \"can be messy, whereas you can eat a boneless wing with a knife and a fork if you need to,\" he said.\n\nBallaney said that customers perceived boneless wings as better value for money because you eat everything you've served.\n\nSome people say boneless wings aren't all they're cracked up to be\nNick White, cofounder of Orange Buffalo, has operated a chicken-wing van in London for 12 years. White told BI that customers ask for boneless wings a handful of times each week, but that the van has never sold them.\n\nWhite said that when Orange Buffalo used to operate restaurants in London, they sold boneless wings. But in the company's van, it's not worth the hassle, he said \u2014 he'd need extra space and staff to bread the chicken before frying.\n\n\"It makes a hell of a mess\" and clogs up the oil in fryers \"big time,\" White said.\n\nSome people don't think boneless wings taste as good as their traditional counterparts, either. Hungry Howie's notes that bone-in wings \"typically have much more flavor,\" describing them as sweeter, juicier, and more tender, because the bone is surrounded by fat.\n\nNot all people know what boneless wings are, anyway. One customer even filed a class-action lawsuit against Buffalo Wild Wings last year, accusing it of \"false and deceptive\" advertising.\n\n\"There are still many customers who think a boneless wing is a wing,\" Ballaney said.",

The Carlingford Oyster Company is a cornerstone of the village, supplying the main ingredient for its annual oyster festival.\n\nIt takes around three years for the company to nurture a fully-grown oyster, first introduced to Carlingford Lough at fingernail size and placed in fine mesh bags. Hand-turned at regular intervals, the oysters are handpicked then placed through a purification process for 42 hours to kill any bacteria or viruses that may have been present.\n\nJames Knight chose Carlingford as its main rock oyster supplier because of the full flavour of the Company\u2019s oysters. Like wine, oysters gain much of their flavour from their terroir, reflecting the minerals, salinity and the type of algae they eat in the water. A Carlingford oyster is full, creamy and rich with a distinct metallic zing.\n\nKian Louet from Carlingford Oysters says, \u201cWe take pride in producing the best quality oysters we can, currently around 2 million per year. Because of the potential health risks associated with oysters, we have meticulous processes in place to ensure that our products are purified, sampled, tested and tested again to eliminate any risk. It means that James Knight\u2019s customers have peace of mind that they have nature\u2019s finest natural ingredients in their kitchens.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy tips on how get the best out of your oyster? First chew it a little! It allows the flavours to fully develop and will help you become a connoisseur. And why not experiment by cooking your oyster, rather than eating them raw \u2013 oyster Rockefeller is a classic dish that we never tire of\u201d, concludes Kian.\n\nWhitelink Seafood\nAt the heart of the cold wet Scottish fishing industry lies the traditional fishing port of Fraserburgh. And at the heart of Fraserburgh lies Whitelink Seafood\u2019s, one of the UK\u2019s most advanced and quality-conscious fish processors of monktails and primefish.\n\n80% of the UK fish catch is landed in Scotland, Fish caught overnight and first thing in the morning, are transported quickly too James Knight Of Mayfair for maximum freshness; and graded,prepared for our chefs, before delivery.\n\n\n\nNorwegian Skrei Cod\nIn Norway, something extraordinary happens every year. Between January and April, millions of migrating cod undertake their annual journey from the Barents Sea, travelling thousands of miles back to their spawning grounds along the northern part of the Norwegian coast.\n\nAs these fish migrate over vast distances, the flesh of these powerful fish becomes exceptionally firm, white and supple. Only the very best of these migrating species become graded as Skrei cod, satisfying very strict criteria:\n\nonly 10% of fish are caught, to ensure stocks are sustained for the future\nall fish are line-caught from day boats\nthe fish must be fully grown (about five years old) and in pristine condition with no scratches or bruising\nIt is packaged within 12 hours of being caught, making it a premium \u2013 yet competitively priced \u2013 fish, which has been certified by the MSC.\n\nJames Knight supplies Skrei cod when it\u2019s in season, with all fish line-tagged for complete peace of mind.",

        "text": "Rare Tea Farm Profile - the Jun Chiyabari Tea Garden\nFull Name: Jun Chiyabari Tea Garden (Moon-lit Tea Garden)\n\nCountry: Nepal\nLocation: Dhankuta, Eastern Nepal\n\nCoordinates: N 27\u00b0 01'E 087\u00b019\u2019\nClosest Town: Hile\n\nAltitude: 1650-2200m. Average 1850m.\nHead Teamaker: Morris Orchard\n\nNumber of Employees: Approx. 200 \u2013 mainly women\nExtract from Infused:\n\u201cTea is, of course, much more than rescue and remedy. It can be a source of pure joy, offering you a proper buzz of elation from its flavour alone. I\u2019m particularly partial to a Nepali black tea for elevenses, and perhaps a ginger biscuit. Specifically, the teas of Jun Chiyabari...\u201d\n\nThe Jun Chiyabari Tea Garden (Moon-lit tea garden \u2013 Jun means \u2018moon\u2019 in Nepali) was started from scratch by two brothers, Bachan and Lochan Gyawali in 2001.\n\nIn early 2000 they began scoping out various sites in Eastern Nepal with the dream of making their own tea.\n\nJun Chiyabri is located in the Dhankuta district, near the small village of Hile - the range in elevation is 1650-2110m above sea level, making it the highest altitude tea garden that we work with.\n\nThey employ over 200 local people, the majority of whom are women.\nOver the years they have slowly been purchasing different plots as and when they can. As a result, the tea garden is made up of 96 hectares spread over 5 divisions throughout the hills \u2013 this mixed range of terroir exemplifies the unique flavour of their finished teas.\nJun Chiyabari has always adhered to organic principles with official certification granted in 2012.\n\nToday, they are moving even further into sustainable practices with a concept known as 'natural farming', an approach popularised by the Japanese philosopher/farmer Masanobu Fukuoka.\n\nIn the beginning, many of the cultivars planted came from Darjeeling, however after a steep learning curve with plenty of trial and error Jun Chiyabari now puts special emphasis on mixed cultivar - you\u2019ll find a wide range of varietals from India, China, Japan and Taiwan. \n\nToday, they\u2019re even starting to create their own \u2013 JO \u2013 Jun Chiyabari Original. \n\nThe gardens are tended and the tea crafted under the wonderful Morris Orchard.\nQuote from Infused:\n\u201cMorris has a round face that creases easily into a deep smile, but there is a seriousness about him, as with Alexander at Satemwa, that comes from the responsibility he carries for the land and the people who live and work on it. Both men are very gentle, thoughtful, quiet even, but with the mischievous streak of revolutionaries and a concrete determination.\u201d\nLanguage is a very important part of the tea philosophy at Jun Chiyabari \u2013 they prefer not to use the term \u2018orthodox\u2019 to describe the type of teas they are making \u2013 they would rather be known for crafting \u2018high mountain teas\u2019. \n\nThere are six harvest seasons at Jun Chiyabari, allowing them to produce a wide array of speciality teas along the oxidisation spectrum.\nThe dates of the harvest vary and depend on the climate and weather; however, they usually fall within these parameters:\n\nEarly Spring: March\n\nSpring: April - early May\n\nDormancy period: mid to end of May\n\nEarly Summer: June - mid-July\n\nSummer: Mid-July - September\n\nAutumn: October - November\n\nWinter: December\n\n\n\n\n\nMorris Orchard and the team have honed their skills over the years, developing unique (and some secret!) crafting methods; each recipe is artisanal and distinctive.\n\nHowever, \u2018recipe\u2019 is a loose term as they rarely focus on specific timings when withering and oxidising the leaves because many external factors come into play; instead they use their senses at every step \u2013 sight, smell and touch.\n\nTea making at its finest.\nWhile employment is critical for providing financial independence, Bachan believes that:\n\n\"...an educated citizenry is singularly the most important asset that a nation can have. We view investment in education in the same way as our nurturing of young tea saplings that grow to become mature, healthy bushes that produced quality teas.\"\n\nWe\u2019re extremely proud to partner with the Jun Chiyabari Tea Garden and share their teas with you.",

I opened it to find the box was made from a cornflakes packet. I didn't have high hopes. I assumed that African tea would be low quality and industrially processed; I knew that a lot of teabag tea came from Kenya and Malawi.\n\nI wasn't prepared for what I was about to taste. I still remember the surprise of those first sips. It was deep but also elegant. There was something rich and familiar, the strong arms of someone who takes care of you, but on top of that such sweetness that I'd only associated with the finest China tea...\n\nI had to go and find the man who made it...\"\n\nHenrietta first visited in 2008, and by 2009 Lost Malawi was on the shelves in Waitrose and our relationship with Satemwa has gone from strength to strength.\n\nThe history of Satemwa\nSatemwa is one of the last independent farms in Malawi \u2013 family run and not owned or managed by agribusiness.\n\nThe local Jesuit mission first brought tea bushes with them to Malawi for their garden. The plants had been taken by the missionaries from China by way of the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. This was the first tea planted in Malawi; it was the 1920s, tea had a high value, and it flourished.\nThe farm is now run by Alex Kay and a dedicated team including Chisomos Custitomu (known as Custom) who takes care of the speciality tea, and Fadson Mandala who takes care of the people (HR manager).\nAlex Kay\n\nChisomos \"Custom\" Custitomu\n\nFadson Mandala\n\nExtract from Infused:\n\"Alex is Malawian; he was born in Malawi and speaks all the local dialects. His Scottish heritage is an interesting story to him, but he\u2019s never been there. He lives in a local house on the farm. Most strikingly, he doesn\u2019t have a superior attitude. I\u2019ve seen a lot of paternalistic hauteur across the tea world, and not by any means just from white men in Africa or India. That attitude seems to come not so much with nationality or skin colour but with wealth and status.\n\nAlex treats everyone with the same thoughtful respect. He\u2019s a gentle, kind, and a truly honourable man. I don\u2019t think he even realises that; it doesn\u2019t occur to him to act in any other way.\"\nSatemwa \u2013 not just a tea garden, a community.\nEnvironmental Sustainbility\nSatemwa has a wide array of diverse crops, enriching the biodiversity of the farm \u2013 tea, coffee, hibiscus, mints, lemongrass, lemon verbena, peppers and many species of trees for shade, fuel and building materials.\nThey share the seedlings with local smallholders to provide valuable income and diversification. Satemwa safely dries the harvested herbs in the tea withering beds and finds routes to market for the smallholder farmers to help their larger community thrive.\nThey ferment organic fertilizers to enrich the soil especially necessary during high drought periods exacerbated by climate change.\nThey have a large nursery project. Not just for baby tea bushes but shade trees - they give away a large number of trees to their neighbours and wider community - as well as expertise on how to care for them. Trees provide shade, biodiversity and their roots enrich soil stability and structure against flooding.\nThroughout the farm there are protected areas of ancient indigenous forest. This provides migrations routes and essential habitats for many species of flora and fauna included bountiful bird life.\n\nThey have herds of cows- roaming the forest floors and the herb rich paths between the tea fields. They provide milk and food for the community and what they leave behind is used to further enrich the land.\nSocial Sustainability\n\nThe farm provides land and builds houses - to encourage good teachers to make their homes in this remote area.\nSecurity\nAlmost all the people of Satemwa are employed year round. Where many plantations rely on seasonal workers, providing no community or long term stability, Satemwa has a different approach. They are rewarded with a stable and highly skilled farm able to produce some of the very best tea in Africa.\n\nTheir emphasis is on handcrafting and skilled work rather than mechanisation. This provides more and better jobs as well as produces far better quality leaf and finished tea. Machine harvesting and processing might be produce cheaper tea but at too higher cost to the community and quality of the tea.\nEconomic Sustainability\nWe pay well for the best tea and herbs from Satemwa. The prices are set by the farm, not us.\nThe garden is too large for us to buy all their harvests. Relatively speaking, we can only buy a small amount. We buy the best quality tea which demands more skill and more labour and a better price. It\u2019s more valuable. We pay seven to twelve times the commodity prices.\n\nSeven big players buy 90% of tea for Europe and North American markets and they have an oligopoly.\nSatemwa is reliant on selling low value tea for teabags through them and a series of brokers because that\u2019s where the biggest market is.\n\nBecause that\u2019s what most people drink. The problem is not supply; its demand.\nIf we can turn the tide and get more people drinking decent tea for a decent price going direct to the farm and their community - then we might see that community really thrive.\nThis is Alex\u2019s dream...\nThis is the dream of all the farmers we work with around the world. Not philanthropy or aid. But a fair exchange. The best tea they can make for the best price. Not the cheapest tea for a price they cannot afford.",

It was considered too difficult to operate in a country torn apart by civil unrest. Communities dependent on tea were abandoned. When peace finally came, the aid agencies, non-profit organisations and various advisors moved in to help rebuild. One of those was Simon Bell, the man behind Amba. He put his money where his mouth was, and rather than just pontificate he bought a farm and tried to establish a new model for sustainable development\u2026\"\n\nBy regenerating Amba Simon hoped to revive both the land, and the lives of the people that lived there.\n\nEmployees at Amba receive fixed salaries set at almost three times more than most people working in the tea industry. These wages are further supplemented by a 10% revenue (not profit) sharing scheme, putting every employee at the centre of what Amba does and achieves.\n\n1% of this shared revenue is put aside in savings for the employee, acting as an insurance scheme that can be utilised should they need anything, such as medical care.\n\nWith good wages and skilled jobs, Amba hopes to provide long term employment for as many people as possible. They also share knowledge with other neighbouring small holders to educate and encourage other tea and herb farmers to adopt organic farming practices. This will allow them to achieve higher prices for their harvests while contributing to the biodiversity of the region.\n\n\n\n\nTaking advantage of all the surrounding resources allows the farm to employ people with an array of skills beyond producing tea. Jams for example, are made from fruit grown on the farm.\n\nThese are then served in the guesthouses and sold in their farm shop alongside other local produce. Sales from the farm shop are then designated for employees as bonuses.\nProcess\nAmba has been organically certified since 2009.\n\nMuch of this land is fertilised by Amba\u2019s own herd of rescue cows that are themselves fed by this incredibly biodiverse terrain. These tea bushes, free of pesticides and chemical fertilisers, are then plucked by hand.\n\nThe trees used for shading across the fields are called \u201cGlyceria\u201d which are known to add nitrogen into the soil and therefore act not only as shade providers, but also as an organic fertiliser.\n\nWhile most high quality teas require plucking two leaves and a bud, Amba goes one step further, with pluckers just selecting the first single leaf and a bud. This meticulous process means Amba produces almost five times less tea than many tea gardens in Sri Lanka each day, but this level of care results in the most sweet and delicate teas.\n\nThe same care and dedication goes into their lemon grass. Carefully hand harvested, sun dried and hand cut.\n\nNeethanjana (head teamaker) joined Amba Estate in 2011 with the aim of finishing his university research (Sociology, Anthropology & Criminal Science) in the field of Tamil & Sinhalese integration in the workplace.\n\nHe finished his research but had already fallen in love with the concept of Amba \u2013 providing opportunities for the community he grew up in \u2013 so he stayed.\nStay\nThere are 15 guest rooms for visitors. Guests can stay in the old main farmhouse, the separate Clove Tree Cottage or line rooms (previous workers accommodation).\n\nThe meals are cooked with the produce from the farm, you can roam around the gardens, join daily tea tours, read a book in the hammock, go on hikes, swim in natural pools or climb Ella Rock.",

Using sustainable farming methods, the award-winning rapeseed oil, which is used in our kitchen at Moor Hall, is sown, grown, harvested and pressed all on Wignalls Farm.\nWignalls Yallo rapeseed oil is 100% cold-pressed, meaning it\u2019s made using a \u2018press\u2019 to squeeze the oil out of the seeds, retaining all the natural flavour. It\u2019s then simply filtered and bottled. Only products labelled as \u2018cold pressed\u2019 are naturally processed without the use of heat and chemicals, keeping in all the goodness.\nPenned as \u2018sunshine in a bottle\u2019 by its producers, Yallo has a subtle yet delicious taste that\u2019s just as good in its purest form for cooking or dressing as it is when used for roasting and frying. It is also packed full of health benefits, being low in saturated fat and a rich source of vitamin E, a natural antioxidant.\nAs well as offering their rapeseed oil in all its original glory, Wignalls Yallo also offer a range infused with additional flavours, such as Lemon & Thyme (perfect for chicken) Cornish Sea Salt & Rosemary (a delicious dressing) Habanero Chilli (for a spicy kick) and Garlic & Garden Herb (a real boost to bread, meat or salads).\nWignalls Yallo recently won a Great Taste Star for 2020 for their oil.\nGET FIVE BOTTLES FOR THE PRICE OF FOUR!\nAn exclusive offer for Moor Hall guests & subscribers!\nSimply buy four bottles of your choice and receive a fifth free!

        "text": "Sourcing\nGO STRAIGHT  TO THE GROWER\nA unique supply chain built on direct relationships, secured through scale.\nFranco and the team on a farm meeting a grower\nOur supply chain bridges the gap between the opaque distribution channels and wholesale markets that dominate, and fiercely localised farm gate schemes and grower markets. This gives our sourcing the transparency of direct grower relationships with the flex and impact that can only be achieved through scale.\nHOW WE SOURCE\n\nRELATIONSHIPS, NOT TRANSACTIONS\n\nWe have spent near 20 years building direct relationships with growers. Refusing to lean on second-hand opinions, we source produce based on face-to-face encounters, tasting fruits and vegetables at their origins. This means more than just knowing our growers by name; it means spending time together out in the field and around the kitchen table. We trust that they are committed to the health of their land and flavour because we have evolved together.\n\nHUBS IN EACH REGION\n\nEach grower is connected to a sourcing hub in London, Paris, Milan, Barcelona, New York, LA, Melbourne, Miami or Copenhagen. Global in scale, our sourcing is local in function, with hubs reaching out to growers in a capillary network. Constant dialogue with our growers makes us nimble and allows us to better withstand global and local shocks. Like exercising a muscle, we\u2019ve got the kind of flex that comes from putting natural variation and human connections first, on a daily basis.\n\nPUSHING BOUNDARIES\n\nFrom making growing plans to offering interest-free loans, we support growers to improve their methods or scale up what they\u2019re doing right without compromising on flavour. Our sourcing also shapes demand, uprooting deep-set conceptions of food. Green Citrus; Winter Tomatoes; Sand-forced Radicchio \u2014 all unheard of or fiercely localised before we stepped in. Now, they\u2019re stand-alone terms on the most innovative menus.\n\nSUPPLY US\nCard row asset\nOUR SOURCING ORIGINS\nRead our story to find out what it took to build our unique supply chain. From a mission to find flavour to a food system revolution, track our evolution and how grower relationships lie at the core of all we do.\nREAD OUR STORY\nCard row asset\nIN SEASON NOW\nLearn what's in season right now. Our direct relationships mean we have our finger on the pulse \u2014 tracking what's growing in the soil, when it will reach its flavour peak and how to experience it at its freshest.\nWHAT'S IN SEASON?\nWHAT WE LOOK FOR IN OUR GROWERS\nWe measure the impact of a grower\u2019s practice on an individual basis. This approach is logistically complex but it means we have real insight into how our growers are actually farming. Fundamentally, we work with growers driven by flavour. More specifically, we look for growers committed to at least one of the following:\n\nBEYOND FRUIT & VEGETABLES\nWe extend our sourcing beyond fresh produce. We work with deli, dairy and dry foods producers who share our commitment to provenance. Plus, we make our own prepped range, juices and whole grain, sourdough bread. By broadening our sourcing, we can have a greater impact on the food system.\nCacao on the tree\nDELI, DAIRY & DRY\nFrom Neal's Yard Dairy to Original Beans, these goods represent a community of independent producers whose skilled combination of traditional methods, cutting-edge technology and innate artistry are challenging the norm.\nORDER ON THE APP\nPicnic set up with Natoora dips\nFOOD TO GO & JUICE\nOur team of London chefs use the same ingredients we source for you in our house-made sauces, dips, soups and juices. Everything is made fresh: no preservatives, unpasteurised and untreated.\nLEARN MORE\n\nALMA BREAD\nAlma is our mill and bakery on a mission to restore the value of whole grain wheat through incredible-tasting sourdough bread. Set up by expert miller and baker Graison Gill, find our team of dedicated bakers under the arches in Bermondsey, London.\nVISIT ALMA\nO",
